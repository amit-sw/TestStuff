AIClub Introduction to Artificial Intelligence9Preface
Artificial Intelligence is a powerful technology that is changing every aspect of 
our lives. But it goes far beyond fun gadgetry. AI is changing the way companies 
use information about their customers, how privacy is managed, and how 
decisions that affect your life - from medical treatments to loan interest rates - 
are made. For our future well-being, it is imperative that this generation, and 
every one after it, becomes “ AI-Literate” . This includes not just understanding 
how the technology works and how to apply it, but also appreciating its 
strengths and weaknesses, and as a human, forming opinions on how it should 
influence and integrate with our lives, our laws, and our societies.
AI Literacy is the ability to understand what Artificial Intelligence is, 
understand its role in our lives, and apply this knowledge to solve problems. 
Kids who learn AI are in a better position to pursue a variety of careers, not just 
in computer science. They are able to understand how AI will impact future jobs 
in all industries, and be able to apply their AI knowledge whether they become 
a computer scientist, a doctor, a lawyer, an artist etc. This book follows the 
philosophy of 4Cs


AIClub Introduction to Artifi  cial Intelligence 10
Th  e four Cs are Concepts, Context, Capability and Creativity. We apply the 4 C’s in all the material 
presented in this book. In each chapter, new AI Concepts are presented. Context for the concepts 
is provided by showing them their connection with real life examples. In every chapter, a pathway 
to build AIs on your own is provided. Th  is ensures that the student has the capability to build in 
addition to understanding the concepts behind it. Every chapter ends with suggestions for a custom 
project, where the student can create an innovation entirely of their choice to demonstrate what 
they have learned. Th  is ensures that their creativity can be translated into real projects.AI literacy and the 4C’s
Our vision is that the next 
generation of kids learn 
these critical technologies 
and in the near term use 
them to help their own 
future, both in college 
and beyond. In the longer 
term, we hope to play a 
role in empowering this 
generation to understand, 
manage and apply these 
skills and their own 
creativity to envision the 
future.Core concepts

Figure 1.1 Devices with AI
Figure 1.2 AI recommenderArtifi  cial intelligence is a group of technologies 
that all have one thing in common. They enable 
computer programs to perform intelligent tasks 
that human brains can naturally do. AI is not one 
technology - it is an umbrella term for a large 
collection of computer techniques. For example, a 
digital assistant in your home that recognizes your 
voice and responds to you is a type of AI. Another 
example of AI is recommendation systems, where 
websites like Netfl  ix use AI to recommend what 
you might like to watch, based on what you have 
watched so far.


17 Fundamentals of Artifi  cial Intelligence
Humans can make some estimates or 
guesses about the future (sometimes 
correctly!). We often try to predict what 
might happen in the future based on 
things that have happened in the past or 
things that we have heard about. AIs can 
also learn patterns from the past and use 
these patterns to forecast the future. Humans display many natural types 
of intelligence. For example, humans 
can easily understand what someone is 
saying to them, even if the speaker is 
a little mumbled, has an accent, or has 
background noise around them. Finding 
the speech pattern and what the speaker 
is saying, even with distractions, is easy 
for humans. However, this is hard for 
computers. It requires a type of AI called 
Speech Recognition.
Did you know?
These are things that come very 
easily to the human brain, but 
can be extremely diﬃ   cult for 
computer programs. Humans can detect if something is unusual. For example, 
if we go to the kitchen and fi  nd it on fi  re, we know that 
this is not normal. We know this because we have learned 
what a normal kitchen should be like. Similarly, AIs can 
also learn what normal is and tell when something is not 
normal. This type of AI is called Anomaly Detection. 
Finally, humans can see and recognize things around us 
simply by looking at them. AIs can also be taught to do 
this - it is called Object Recognition.
Humans are constantly trying to fi  gure out how to 
automate things and decrease the amount of work we have 
to do. AIs play a big part in that. By teaching computers 
how to do some things that humans can do, we can 
automate many tasks and free up humans to work on 
harder problems that computers cannot handle. 
For example, in medicine, a machine can take an eye scan 
of a patient, but a medical expert is required to read the 
scan to tell whether the eye is healthy. In some countries, 
there aren’t enough medical experts to read everyone’s 
eye scans. An AI can be taught to read the scan and select 
which patients need to see a doctor. If an AI can automate 
this - it does not replace the doctor. It just means that the 
doctor can now treat many more patients because the AI 
can help the doctor understand which patients are most at 
risk.Figure 1.3 Humans performing normal tasks

There are many AI’s that exist in our daily 
lives. For example, if you have ever gone to 
Netfl  ix and watched a movie - you have likely 
interacted with an AI. After the movie, if Netfl  ix 
has recommended other movies that you might 
like to watch, that is an example of artifi  cial 
intelligence. This kind of AI is called product 
recommendations.  It learns from user patterns 
and what you might like based on what else you 
have watched and what other people like you have 
watched.
Artiﬁ  cial Intelligence around us
18Figure 1.5 Netfl  ix recommender
Figure 1.6 Amazon recommender
Figures 1.7 Digital assistants on phones and at homeProduct recommendations are on many 
websites today. For example, on websites like 
Amazon, if you decided to buy something, it 
will recommend other things for you to buy. It 
will also tell you about things that other people 
who bought the same product have been 
interested in.
Another cool application of AI is Digital 
assistants. You will fi  nd them on your 
smartphone, Google Home, Alexa, Siri etc. 
They can answer questions, set alarms, play 
music, and so on. They use AIs because they 
need to understand your voice, understand 
what you are saying, and respond.

Artiﬁ  cial Intelligence around us
There are also many AIs in daily life that are not as visible. For 
example, AIs in banks help to detect credit card fraud. If you 
get a call from your credit card company and they are telling 
you that there is a suspicious activity on your credit card, it 
is usually an AI that spotted that. Similarly, AIs are used to 
approve loans, detect diseases, forecast sales for business, and 
more.Did you know these are things that 
are very easy for AI, but can be quite 
hard for humans to do
These are all diﬀ  erent examples of AI in 
real life and they are all computer programs 
that are trying to do the kinds of things that 
humans can do. So, are all these diﬀ  erent 
AIs or one big brain? One of the biggest 
diﬀ  erences between AIs and humans is that 
human intelligence is all in our one brain. 
AIs are specialized for specifi  c tasks. 
For example, the AI in your digital assistant 
is likely not able to detect credit card fraud. 
Similarly, an AI that approves loans is 
probably not programmed to play music for 
you or recommend movies. Each AI is taught 
to do a very specifi  c job. Given that, some 
AIs can be very good at their job - and can 
even beat a human at it! However, humans 
are very good at generalized intelligence 
- learning how to do many things and 
combining what we learn.

AI is already being used in nearly every commercial industry. Every day, people discover new things 
that they can do with AI, and new benefi  ts that it can provide. This is one of the great strengths of AI. 
When we can teach a computer to learn from data, we can apply it to any problem that we have data 
about. Below are some of the benefi  ts that people, companies, and countries are seeing with AI. Beneﬁ  ts of AI
There are lots of hidden patterns in 
data that sometimes humans cannot 
see, because either the data is too large 
or because the humans are not looking 
for the pattern. AIs can be masters 
at fi  nding such patterns. See some 
examples below. 1. Gathering insights from data
AI helps detect COVIDAI helps detect COVID
In 2020, researchers at the Mount Sinai Health 
System in New York found that people who 
get COVID-19 display a small change in their 
heart rhythms a week or two before developing 
symptoms. These small changes can be detected 
by their smartwatch. This means that AI can 
detect COVID-19 earlier than existing tests, and 
without any invasive testing or human contact 
with testers.

Figure 1.15 AI improving productivity
AIs are very good at determining what a normal pattern 
is and distinguishing normal and abnormal behavior. 
This can be useful in many real-world contexts to detect 
failures, fraud, etc.  2. Detec�  ng Anomalies (Unusual ac�  vity)
AI helps detect credit card fraudAI helps detect credit card fraud
Financial companies use AI every day 
to detect credit card fraud. AIs can study 
the patterns of each person’s credit 
card use, and detect whether unusual 
purchases are being made. If this 
happens, the bank can call the customer 
and make sure the credit card has not 
been stolen. 
One of the most powerful uses 
of AI is to help humans become 
more productive. We spend a lot 
of time every day doing simple 
things that do not require much 
brain power but take up our time. 
Examples are fi  nding directions, 
writing emails etc. Auto-
correct for emails, GPS driving 
directions, are all examples that 
can help us oﬄ   oad these tasks.

If we recorded a video and want to translate it to a 
diﬀ  erent language, AIs can do this automatically. This 
saves a human the time it takes to write down what the 
fi  rst video said, translate it, and then convert it back into 
voice in a second language.

AI helps improve eﬃ   ciencyAI helps improve eﬃ   ciency
When Amazon replaced many of the workers in its 
factories with robots, it also created a program to 
retrain these workers to manage the robots. This 
was benefi  cial in many respects - the robots handle 
the hard and sometimes dangerous work, and 
the humans focus on what the robots cannot do - 
things that require higher intelligence.
AIs can also be used to automate tasks. Initially, 
simple tasks, such as fi  lling out forms, can be 
automated. Have you noticed that, when you are 
checking out of a shopping site, your browser 
automatically oﬀ  ers to fi  ll in your credit card 
information? This is an example of automation. 
AI in automation is also a cause for concern 
- many humans are worried that AI will take 
away their jobs, and there is a very real threat 
of massive workforce displacement due to 
automation. This is also why it is so important 
that as many people as possible become AI 
Literate, so that they can work in a world where 
simple tasks are handled by AIs and more 
complex tasks (like managing the AI!) is handled 
by a human.

AIs learn from historical data and from 
humans, both of which can be biased. AIs 
are also very good at detecting patterns, 
so they can extract out biases that may not 
even be visible to humans. 
AIs that pick up biases in these ways 
can then propagate the bias by making 
predictions that hurt minorities or other 
underrepresented groups. Detecting and 
countering AI Bias is a major challenge. 
Any person working of AI should be aware 
of this issue.1. AI BiasWhile AI has generated a lot of value and benefi  ts around the world, as AI becomes more pervasive, 
it is also generating challenges. In this chapter, a short summary of AI challenges is covered. An in 
depth coverage is provided in Chapter 4 of this book!Challenges of AI
Example of AI BiasExample of AI Bias
COMPAS (Correctional Oﬀ  ender 
Management Profi  ling for Alternative 
Sanctions) COMPAS is a popular algorithm 
used to advise the penitentiary system 
whether an inmate up for parole was likely 
to re-oﬀ  end. This algorithm was later 
discovered to be biased against African 
Americans, which means that African 
Americans were much more likely to be 
predicted as re-oﬀ  enders than Americans of 
a diﬀ  erent race with the exact same profi  le. 
The bias in the algorithm was discovered 
by a 2 year follow up study.

Example of AI and Privacy.Example of AI and Privacy.Since AI can detect patterns such as faces, 
companies and governments can now use 
AI in ways that violate privacy. As we 
buy things, browse the Internet, comment 
on social media, or even walk down the 
street, information is being gathered about 
us through our computer, street cameras, 
devices in our homes, and more. 
This creates many privacy concerns 
since we don’t know what companies 
or governments have access to this 
information and what they may choose 
to do with it. There are laws emerging 
in diﬀ  erent countries and cities to 
regulate what information companies and 
governments can use.2. AI and Privacy

25 Fundamentals of Artifi  cial IntelligenceCountries all around the world are racing to adopt AI because they believe it will be an important part 
of their workforce being competitive in the global market of the future. There is a risk that poorer 
countries will be even further behind because they lack the resources to learn AI, and even within rich 
countries, that poorer communities will be set even further back. Non-profi  t organizations are making 
free resources available to such at risk communities to help them also learn AI.3. AI and Equality
Example of AI Bias - ImageNet RouletteExample of AI Bias - ImageNet Roulette
In 2019, AI researcher Kate Crawford and artist Trevor Paglen created ImageNet Roulette, 
a project designed to demonstrate how AI algorithms can learn Bias. They trained an AI on 
ImageNet, a very popular dataset that is used to train many image classifi  cation AIs. They 
then encouraged individuals to submit their photos to see what the AI thought the person’s 
profession was. Many instances of bias were discovered, including African Americans being 
labeled as wrongdoer or oﬀ  ender, and an Asian woman being classifi  ed as a jihadist .
This exhibition increased public awareness of the biases that AI can learn, and caused the 
team that created the ImageNet dataset to commit to removing over 600,000 images from the 
dataset.

Fundamentals of Artifi  cial Intelligence 26While AIs are capable of amazing things, building an AI (particularly a large and powerful 
one) uses a lot of computing power. 
Figure 1.24 shows how much compute power it takes to train a lar ge AI model once. Most 
large AI models also do not train just once. They train many many times. 4. AI and Environment
Because of this concern of energy usage and carbon footprint, researchers are now looking 
to build eﬃ   cient AIs that may not be as accurate, but are much more eﬃ   cient in power and 
compute use.Figure 1.24 How much energy it takes to train a large AI model compared to other tasks

27 Fundamentals of Artifi  cial IntelligenceHistory has shown us that technologies by themselves do not 
generate good or harm. Whatever good or harm a technology 
generates depends on how humans choose to use it. The 
nuclear technology that powers entire cities today has the 
same roots as the technology that caused Chernobyl, one of 
the world’s worst nuclear disasters, as well as the nuclear 
bomb.
AI is a new technology with profound implications for 
humanity, and how it develops depends on how humans 
choose to shape it. AI Ethics is critical to ensuring that AI 
develops safely and supports the wellbeing of humans and the planet. AI Ethics is a multi-faceted topic 
(you will see more details in Chapter 4), and is still a nascent topic where new solutions are needed.
Example of AI helping the environmentExample of AI helping the environment
As AI expands, humans are fi  nding that AI is both a benefi  t and a detriment to the environment. 
AI is already being used successfully in everything from wildfi  re detection to helping businesses 
streamline operations to be more energy eﬃ   cient.
However, AI consumes a great deal of energy on its own, and generates a signifi  cant amount of 
carbon emissions. Researchers have shown that a single large AI can generate as much CO2 as 
fi  ve cars in their lifetime. Because of this, new technologies are being developed to create energy 
eﬃ   cient AIs that perform nearly as well as their energy-hungry counterparts but consume a lot 
less resources. 
There are many other AI challenges that are faced more by corporations that are building AI. They 
include how to make sure that the AI is not hacked (AI Security) and understanding if the AI can fail in 
practice, and how to detect and fi  x it (Production AI Health)Figure 1.25 Responding to wildfi  res

Here’s how COVID broke AIHere’s how COVID broke AI
For sellers like Amazon,  when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, buying behavior of people on amazon 
underwent a drastic change. The top selling products on amazon changed drastically from phone cases, 
phone chargers and legos to face masks, hand sanitizer etc.
Behind the scenes, artifi  cial intelligence (AI) algorithms are used for inventory management, fraud 
detection, marketing etc and such a drastic change in the purchasing behavior of people causes the 
algorithms to break. They stopped working as expected
For suppliers of products, 
an AI algorithm predicts 
demand based on historical 
information. The production 
system typically has 
fl  exibility to deal with 
smooth and periodic changes. 
However, a drastic change 
like the COVID-19 pandemic 
caused a sudden change in 
the type of orders that were 
being received. As a result, 
the algorithms used for 
forecasting and managing the 
production pipelines were no 
longer working as expected.

In this chapter, diff  erent types of AI are described along with how an AI learns and all 
the diff  erent stages involved in it’s creation.

 How AIs learn

AIs need to learn. This is a fundamental aspect of AI, from which comes many of it’s 
strengths and also it’s challenges. The fact that AIs can learn implies that they can get better 
over time, and that more information can lead to smarter AIs. Over the past few years, there 
have been massive advances in both, the techniques of AI learning (also called training) and 
the types of things that AIs can learn.
Why do AIs need to learn?
36Once an AI has learned, it stores 
the information that it has learned 
in a structure called a Model. A 
model is the AI’s brain. It is the 
repository of the essence of the 
learning. The model is typically 
stored as a fi  le, and depending on 
the type of AI, it can be as small as 
two values, or as large as trillions 
of values.

37 How AIs learn How AIs learn
In this section, we review three of the most common variants of AI learning - Supervised 
Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.Once an AI learns and generates a Model, it is able to answer questions that it has not 
previously seen, based on the insights that it has learned during training. This phase is called 
Prediction  or Inference.

How AIs learn 38
In supervised learning, the AI is given many examples of the types of questions it is expected to 
answer, and the correct answer for each question. By analyzing these, it attempts to discover the 
patterns that match questions to answers. The answer is called the Label . Since supervised learning 
requires the correct answer, it requires labeled training data, or data for which the right answer is 
known.  In the example below, the data shows an AI whether a person is an Adult or a Child based on 
the Number of Countries the person has visited, the Years in School, and the Height in feet. The label is 
Who am I? - Adult  or Child.1. Supervised Learning 
Example of Supervised Learning Example of Supervised Learning 
If a bank wants to build an AI to predict 
which customer is likely to leave the bank, 
it can use historical data about each past 
customer, with a label that states whether 
that customer left the bank. With such a 
dataset, the AI can learn the diff  erence 
between customers who are likely to leave 
and customers who are likely to stay. Once 
the AI is trained, the resulting Model can be 
used to predict whether a new customer will 
leave or stay.

39 How AIs learn How AIs learn
In this form of learning, the AI is not given the 
right answers but is expected to learn patterns 
within the data rather than match a data pattern 
to an answer. A good example of unsupervised 
learning is detecting anomalies or unusual 
behavior. 
If a credit card is stolen, it is likely that the 
thief will use the credit card in a way unlike 
what the owner did. An AI that has historical 
information about the purchase patterns on 
this credit card can establish a baseline - what 
normal purchasing behavior for this customer 
looks like. Once the thief starts buying things 
with the credit card, the AI can detect these 
purchases as unusual and fl  ag an alert.2. Unsupervised Learning 
Another popular class of algorithms in unsupervised learning is clustering. Given a dataset, 
clustering refers to dividing it into groups that are similar. One such metric of similarity 
is distance. Using this metric, the algorithm will cluster points that are close to each other . 
Figure 2.8 shows an example where the algorithms grouped the points into 3 clusters, where 
each cluster is represented by a diff  erent color.Figure 2.7 Examples of unsupervised learning
Figure 2.8 Example of cluster grouping


How AIs learn 40In Reinforcement Learning, the AI experiments 
and is given a reward for success. Over 
time, the AI remembers what experimental 
steps led to success and what did not, and 
becomes better at optimizing for the reward. 
Reinforcement learning AIs operate in two 
modes - Exploration and Exploitation. In 
Exploration, the AI tries new techniques to see 
what may result in a reward. In Exploitation, 
the AI uses techniques that were previously 
successful in order to get another reward. 
Most AIs that play and win games are using 
some form of Reinforcement Learning. In 
this case, techniques are new strategies in the 
game, and the reward is winning the game. 
By playing a very large number of games over 
time, the AI can accumulate a series of winning 
strategies and become very good at the game.3. Reinforcement Learning 
Alpha GOAlpha GO
AlphaGo is an artifi  cial intelligence 
(AI) agent that is specialized to 
play Go, a Chinese strategy board 
game, against human competitors. 
AlphaGo is a Google DeepMind 
project. The ability to create a 
learning algorithm that can beat a 
human player at strategic games is a 
measure of AI development. This AI 
has been extensively trained using 
both human and computer play for it 
to learn.

41 How AIs learn How AIs learn
Many types of AIs learn from data. In the case of supervised learning, the data is the questions and 
the answers. In unsupervised learning, the data has no explicit questions or answers, but is presented 
to the AI for it to learn patterns within.Data and AI
Real world data comes in many forms and diff  erent types of AIs have been shown to excel at each of 
them. Figure 2.11 shows examples of diff  erent types of data.
Where does all this data come from?Where does all this data come from?
One of the reasons AI has become so popular 
in the last few years is that companies have 
gathered up a lot of data about consumers 
and can use it to create powerful AIs. Other 
types of data such as books have also 
become digitized. Rich data from video and 
audio recordings and  data from Internet 
of Things (IoT) devices like sensors are 
generating large amounts of machine data. 
This data is now stored and ready to be 
analyzed, and AI is the key to learning the 
secrets hidden within the data.

are multiple columns, and in the case of labeled data, one of these columns is the label or correct 
answer. The other columns are a part of the question and are called Features. Examples of structured 
data include anything that can be placed in a database, like tables. These can be fi  nancial records, sales

is learning to predict the price of a house from the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and 
the number of bathrooms. These three pieces of information are the features. The label is the price 
of the house. Once the AI learns, it creates a model which is then placed into a prediction program. 
The prediction program is given the details of a new house (size, number of bedrooms, and number 
of bathrooms) and expected to output the price of the house. The prediction program takes this 
information and processes it through the model to predict the price.
Figure 2.15 shows an example of unstructured data with labels. In this case, the AI is trained on images 
of cats and dogs. After training, the AI is given a new image and will predict whether it is a cat or a 
dog.

Time Temperature

This means you can append to existing data, but not change the order of data that is already 
recorded. This is a special aspect of time series data. Other types of data, such as a collection of 
images or typical CSV (comma separated values) files assume independence between different 
samples. Which means the samples can be shuffled without impacting analysis or insights about the 
data. Each data point in time series is typically statistically dependent on the previous data point and 
that makes it a unique type of data.Figure 2.17 Time Series DataThere are also other types of data, 
such as time series data. A good 
example of time series data is stock 
prices over time. Another good 
example of Time Series data is data 
emitted by sensors. For example, if 
you have a temperature sensor in your 
home that emits data every 5 minutes, 
that would be time series data. Since 
time series data is recorded over time, 
it is immutable.

Figure 2.20 shows a typical life cycle of creating an Artifi  cial Intelligence service. While AI can be 
used to solve many types of problems, the steps of the life cycle stay lar gely the same.
The fi  rst step is to decide what problem should be solved with AI. An example problem could be to 
recommend new products to customers, or new movies or books. While defi  ning the problem, its 
important to understand what a successful AI would look like. The ProblemFigure 2.20 Stages of building an AIBusiness

How AIs learn 46
For example, an AI that recommends 
products would be successful if 
the customer actually clicks on the 
recommended products and ideally buys 
one. If the AI recommends products but 
you discover over time that no one buys 
the recommended product, the AI has not 
been successful.
Once the problem to be solved is clear, the 
next step is the data. To recommend products, 
the AI needs to learn how things a customer 
has bought can be used to predict what else 
they may like. For example, if a customer 
bought balloons and cake decorations, they 
may be planning a party and might want other 
party supplies. To learn these patterns, the AI 
will need historical data about customers and 
their purchase histories.The Data

OTT (Over-the-top media service) refers to 
media services that are off  ered directly to 
viewers over the Internet. Some examples of 
such platforms are Netfl  ix, Disney+, Hulu, 
Amazon Prime Video, etc. These services 
typically have a subscription which users can 
sign up for and watch content. As a result, 
these services have data about what types of 
content diff  erent users watch. Figure 2.21 A website recommending products

They leverage this data to train AIs that provide personalized recommendations to diff  erent 
users. The goal of this AI is to recommend a show or movie that has a high chance of  
viewership from you based on what you have watched so far. This AI uses information such 
as viewing history, genres, watch time, etc about you and tries to match you with similar 
users and the types of content that they watched and you have not watched yet. The goal of 
these AIs is to make meaningful recommendations that bring joy to customers so that you

on the patterns it fi  nds in the training data.Concept

How long does training take?How long does training take?
AI training times can vary substantially depending on the type of data used, the type of AI 
algorithm being trained, and the size of the data. Simple datasets, such as tables with a few 
hundred rows and tens of columns, can train in fi  ve to ten minutes for machine learning 
algorithms, with deep learning algorithms taking a bit longer. Images data, video data, and 
other complex datasets can take hours to days, or even weeks to train. Other advanced AIs, 
such as the AIs that create images or videos, can take even longer.
There are many hardware options now to speed up AIs. The most popular is GPU (Graphics 
Processing Unit’s), created by companies like Nvidia. Other companies have also built 
hardware to make AI training faster, including Tensor Processing Unit’s (TPUs) from Google, 
and special instructions in computers from companies like Intel.Did you know?

After completing the previous step, the AI should be doing well on it’s metrics. Recall from 
previous sections that this AI has a model (a fi  le that contains numbers describing what it 
has learned - it’s brain). For this AI to be useful, this model has to be put in a place where 
it can answer new questions. This is called Deployment . Once the AI is deployed, it can 
answer questions to solve the problem. For example, in the case of a product recommendation 
AI, deploying would mean running it in a computer program where information about new 
customers can come in and the AI can recommend future products.Deploying the AI
An important part of training an AI is tuning it. Tuning requires measuring how well the AI is 
doing followed by steps to improve it. Each type of AI has a set of Metrics by which it can be 
measured (more on this in later chapters). While tuning, data can be changed, AI type can be 
changed, or each AI can be individually tuned to see how the metrics change. Most AIs have 
many tuning options (called hyper-parameters - you will learn more about this in later chapters). 
By changing the values of these hyper parameters, one can change how well the AI learns. In later 
chapters, diff  erent hyper-parameters of diff  erent algorithms are described along with metrics by 
which their performance can quantify the quality of an AI.Tuning the AI
A hyper parameter is a parameter that is set before the learning process 
begins. These parameters are tunable and can directly aff  ect how well a 
model trains.Concept

49 How AIs learn How AIs learnOnce the AI is deployed, 
it needs to be connected to 
an application so that it can 
be used. For the production 
recommendation AI, this 
application may be a shopping 
website. Customers come to 
the website and buy products. 
When a customer browses a 
product, information about the 
customer and the product is 
sent to the deployed AI. The 
AI uses this information to 
recommend other products, 
and these recommendations are 
displayed for the customer on 
the website.Connec�  ng the AI to an applica�  on

Once an AI has been deployed into production, the process of ensuring that it 
makes predictions as expected under external variations in data, software and 
environment is called monitoring.Concept
Monitoring 


How AIs learn 50Once the AI is connected to the application, one round of the 
life cycle is complete! However it is very important to keep 
monitoring the AI to make sure that it is performing well. 
For example, AIs can break if the types of questions that are 
asked do not resemble anything they saw in training. AIs can 
also break if there are bugs (mistakes) in the software that 
built the AI. Some AIs are also susceptible to hackers who can 
try to break the AI. For all these reasons and more, it is very 
important to keep monitoring the AI.Monitoring the AI
It is very important that the 
AI is only asked questions 
that it is trained to answer. 
If questions that it does not 
know about are asked, it 
will not say “I don’t know”. 
It will give the wrong 
answer because it has no 
idea that it does not know.
It is very important to repeat this life cycle and continue to improve the AI. Sometimes this iteration 
happens because there is new data and a better model can be build using it. Sometimes while building 
the fi  rst iteration, ways to make it better are discovered. All real world AIs iterate, and the more they 
iterate, the better the AI becomes at solving the problem.And repeat!

AIs learn from data, so the more recent the data, the more likely that the AI’s knowledge 
is up to date. This is particularly important for AIs in environments where information 
changes quickly (like news sites or shopping sites). As an example - imagine that you are 
the owner of a clothing website. A famous movie star unexpectedly wore a dress that you 
carry. Suddenly orders for this dress skyrocket on your website. You would want to adapt 
to this quickly - and have your AI recommend this dress to anyone who may be interested. 
Adapting quickly is key, because this trend may not even last a few days - the moment 
some other movie star wears something else, this trend may end.
AIs in the real world can train as 
frequently as every 15 minutes, or 
as infrequently as once per year. The 
factors that drive retraining frequency 
include - how quickly does the data 
change?, Does the AI need to pass any 
legal reviews (as they do in medical and 
fi  nance industries), will retraining the 
AI make it more accurate and bring the 
business more money?

In this section, parts of the life cycle where the AI learns are explored in more depth. In particular, 
how algorithms are selected, how AIs are measured during training are explored.Stages of Learning
There are many diff  erent types of algorithms available for any problem. Which algorithm should be 
selected depends on the type of data and whether it has labels (right answers). Figure 2.32 shows a 
decision making process that can be used. If there are labels, it is a supervised learning problem and 
one or more supervised learning algorithms should be selected. Selec�  ng an Algorithm
Once the type of problem is determined, one or more algorithms can be selected. Later in this book 
diff  erent types of algorithms and how to match them to data types is described.If there are no labels and the problem requires the AI to take in data and provide an answer, it is 
likely an unsupervised learning problem. If the AI is expected to interact, make decisions and create 
strategies, it is likely a reinforcement learning problem. Figure 2.32 Decision making process to select algorithms

How AIs learn How AIs learn
Different types of AI are measured 
differently. In all cases, the goal is to 
determine whether the AI is behaving 
well and, once tuned, whether the AI is 
getting better. 
However, the way the performance 
of an AI is measured is different for 
supervised learning, unsupervised 
learning, and reinforcement learning.Training and Measuring the AI
In supervised learning, since the dataset has the correct answer , it is possible to give the AI a test 
where the AI is asked some questions from the dataset and it’s answer is compared to the correct 
answer. To do this, the original data is split into two parts - the Training Dataset  and the Testing  
or Validation Dataset . The AI only sees the Training Dataset  while it is training. After the AI 
has trained and created a model, the model is given questions from the validation dataset and the 
AI’s answers are compared with the correct answers. Common ways to split the dataset include 
giving 80% to the training dataset and 20% to the validation dataset, or giving 70% to the training 
dataset and 30% to the validation dataset. Some data scientists do select other split’ s if they feel it 
is better for their problem.Types of AI Algorithms
Once the type of learning has been determined, there are several types of algorithms within each 
type. If a problem needs Supervised Learning, one can choose from a lar ge variety of algorithms 
such as K-nearest neighbors, linear regression, decision trees, neural networks etc. If a problem 
needs unsupervised learning, one can choose from a large variety of anomaly detection and 
clustering algorithms. Similarly, there are several different types of reinforcement learning that 
one can choose from. Given a dataset and problem type, the next logical question is how can one 
determine the best algorithm to use for it. This choice is made by studying the characteristics of 
data. In the case of supervised learning, if the label is a discrete or categorical value like adult or 
child, happy or sad etc, there are certain types of algorithms that are suitable for it. Details of these 
algorithms are presented in Chapters 5 and 6. The distribution of data within the features can also 
give some insights into what type of algorithms will work well with it. Sometimes, it is not possible 
to estimate which algorithms will work well by analyzing the data. In such cases, it is common to 
launch many different algorithms and pick the one that is the best at making predictions.

Auto Machine LearningAuto Machine LearningThe amount of time taken to train an AI depends on the (a) size of data (b) type of algorithm and (c) 
confi  guration of the compute. Ranges of time taken to train an AI vary from fraction of a second to 6 
months.Did you know?
Since there are hundreds or thousands of possible 
AI algorithms for any dataset, it is not practical 
for a data scientist to run them all. Enter AutoML. 
AutoML is a technique where a software program 
(itself a type of AI!) can take the dataset and run it 
against hundreds or thousands of AIs to see which 
one will train best on the dataset. Using metrics like 
accuracy, AutoML can then show the data scientist 
which algorithms perform better.
AutoML is now an established approach, with 
companies like Google and Amazon off  ering 
AutoML software. AutoML is part of a wave 
of Democratization of AI, which is to make 
AI accessible to everyone, not just people with 
Ph.Ds. Some argue that AutoML will replace data 
scientists, while others argue that it will free up data 
scientists to focus on other parts of their job, such as 
making sure they have the best data.

Core Concepts
After studying this chapter - students should be able to understand the following:
• AIs need to learn
• AIs learn in many diff  erent ways. Three common ways are Supervised, Unsupervised and 
Reinforcement.
• All AIs learn from the information. Most of the time, this information is provided from data. 
Data itself comes in many forms.
• AIs that are built in real life have a life cycle. The life cycle includes the stages that need to 
be followed to get a good working AI, and then the life cycle repeats to improve the AI.
• Even within the life cycle, Learning is a very important step that can have many stages.
Grade Level Alignment
The concepts in this chapter are accessible to any middle school or high school grade level.  
High school students may have had exposure to basic statistics and as such will be able to 
appreciate the link between data and statistics.
Some �  ps for discussions when teaching this chapter:
• Encourage students to think about the sources of data around them. Do they generate data 
(for example from their internet searches, essays they write etc.). Do our shopping patterns 
and TV viewing patterns generate data?
• How much data is out there? Encourage students to do a Google search to fi  nd out.
• Is data growing? Encourage students to do a Google search to fi  nd out.
• Without AI, what else can humans do with data?

3Data for AI
Humans are constantly learning from data. Data can be in many forms. Visual data 
such as the environment a human sees around using their eyes, audio data such as 
the language people speak, music, birds chirping etc. Humans receive data through 
the senses of sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste. Human brains naturally combine 
these learnings and help make decisions.


Data for AI 62
How does AI use Data
As seen in previous chapters, AI uses data to learn patterns. Real world AIs can use millions of 
examples every time they train. By extracting patterns from data, AIs create models, which are the 
equivalent of their brains. These models can then be used to interpret new data and answer new 
questions.
Does more data help? Usually, it does, but not always. If the problem is complex, more data can help 
the AI learn the true patterns that exist in the real life problem. If there is not enough data, the AI may 
not be able to extract the whole pattern. On the other hand, if there is too much useless or irrelevant 
data, it can confuse the AI and make it harder for the AI to learn a good model. This is where data 
scientists come in. A large part of their job is to select and organize the data so that an AI can be trained 
eff  ectively on it.
Data in the AI Life cycle
Figure 3.1 revisits the AI life cycle that 
was explained in Chapter 2. Data plays an 
important role in this life cycle.
1. During Business Need, the problem that 
the AI will solve has to be determined, and 
this, in turn, will determine what data is 
needed for the AI to learn. For example, 
if the goal of the AI is to predict which 
customers will leave a bank, the data will 
need to include examples of past customers 
who have left the bank and past customers 
who have stayed. 
Real life corporations process massive amounts 
of data every day for AI. This process is called 
ETL (Extract, Transform and Load). With ETL, 
companies get the data from it’s original source, 
process it, and store it for use by AI and other 
applications.Data for AI in Real Life: ETLData for AI in Real Life: ETL

people who stayed.

63 Data for AI Data for AI2. During the Data step, all the data that the AI needs to learn from should be gathered. It should be 
ensured that the collected data is in a format that will make it easier for the AI to learn from. This 
chapter will cover the details of how this can be done.
3. Once the model is trained, it should be tested with data that it has never seen before, to make sure 
that the model has learned patterns well and not just memorized the training data. AIs that learned 
patterns well will do well on new data that has not been seen before (was not a part of  the training 
data).
4. Finally, when the model is deployed and connected to the business application, it will continually 
see new data and will be able to answer questions and make decisions.
5. Over time, the model may be trained again. This can happen if new data becomes available, or 
better data becomes available. It can also happen if the engineers and data scientists fi  nd better ways 
of training on the existing data. 
What does a Data Scientist do?What does a Data Scientist do?
Data scientist is one of the fastest growing jobs 
in the world. At the time of this book writing, 
there is a worldwide shortage of data scientists 
that is blocking the growth of AI in industry. 
A data scientist’s job is to solve problems by 
fi  nding the right data, preparing the data to be 
ready for an AI algorithm (called Data Cleaning, 
Data Preparation or Feature Engineering) and 
fi  nding the right algorithms to train from the 
data and make predictions. 
AIs use data in many stages of the life cycle. Data is fi  rst used to train the 
AI, and then additional data is used to test the AI. Once the AI is deployed 
and in production, new data is presented to the AI all the time and the AI is 
expected to make good predictions on the new data. Over time, the AI may 
be retrained to accommodate new or better data.

 Camera
There was a time in history when cameras 
were expensive and hard to come by for 
a large section of the population. With 
advances in technology, cameras are now 
cheap and easily accessible. They are on 
phones, security systems and everywhere 
around us. It has become very easy to 
use these cameras to take and share 
pictures and videos over the internet.
Cameras are a huge source of data and 
as high resolution cameras become more 
common, the images and videos captured 
by them will be of better quality and will 
occupy much more space on the computer.Sources of Data
The AI needs data to learn. We can get data from sensors such as cameras, 
audio recordings, simple tables that record things like temperature etc. There 
are many sensors in the world that capture data all the time. For example, 
surveillance cameras, phones, sensors attached to machines which record 
things like temperature, pressure etc. All this data is saved as fi  les in computers 
However, unlike humans who are constantly learning from data, this data is 
not necessarily being used to learn and make intelligent decisions unless an AI 
is built.Concept

Phones collect a lot of data in a day. Phones 
typically have cameras and taking a picture 
using the camera collects data of a particular 
type called image. However, this is not the 
only data collected by a phone. A phone 
typically has sensors such as an accelerometer, 
a gyroscope that collect information about 
motion. A phone can also capture audio data. 
For example, if you use the digital assistant 
service on your phone such as Siri or Google, 
it records your voice. The messages you type 
on the phone to communicate or post on social 
media are also data generated by the phone. 
In addition, apps installed on the phone can 
capture data about your interests and habit’s 
based on usage patterns. 
We are generating more than 30

and this number will grow to be 
bigger and bigger over time.  When you log in to a computer and browse 
diff  erent websites, they can collect information

Data for AI 70How is Data Stored?
Files
A lot of data can be stored in fi  les. A fi  le 
is a collection of data that is in order (the 
fi  rst data is at the beginning of the fi  le, 
then the middle, and so on). Files can 
be varied lengths and can have human 
readable names. Files are often named with 
extensions that describe what type of data 
it is. For example, a fi  le data.txt would 
likely be text or numbers data. A fi  le data.
csv would imply data that are in rows with 
every element separated by a comma. data.
jpeg is likely an image in JPEG format. 
Files can be organized into Folders which 
are also called Directories. 
Databases
A database is an application that stores and 
retrieves data. It is particularly good to use 
databases if you want to select and query 
parts of the data. For example, if you own a 
bookstore and need to track every order, you 
can put the order data into a database. You 
can then query for orders on a given day, all 
orders by the same customer, etc.
Data that is in tabular format can frequently 
be stored in databases. Other types of data 
can be in databases as well. These days, a 
database can hold almost any type of data. It 
can also hold collections of fi  les!

Computer Memory
When a program processes the data, the data is usually 
in the memory of the computer that is running the 
program.  The data may not be in the memory all the 
time however. Most computer memories today are 
volatile , which means that the contents are lost if the 
computer is restarted. So your data will likely live in 
some other location, and be brought into memory when 
the program needs to access it. 
If your data is stored in fi  les or databases (or in any other 
way), parts of these fi  les and databases are brought into 
the computer memory when they are needed.
In the long term, your data will likely reside in Storage.  
Storage, unlike Memory is often Non-Volatile  or 
Persistent , meaning that if you turn off   the computer, 
the data is still preserved. There are many types of non-
volatile storage. The most popular today are Magnetic 
Disk Drives and Solid State Drives. If you own a 
laptop, chances are your laptop has one of these types 
of storage, and that is where your fi  les and databases 
live. A cell phone also has storage, to keep photos etc.
There is also storage you can access over the internet, 
like Cloud Storage. Cloud storage uses similar 
hardware, but is grouped and maintained in data centers 
(huge computer facilities). You can access this storage 
through the internet and keep fi  les to access from 
anywhere. Storage

Data for AI72Data is saved in the computers in a standard format. A standard format is used so that different 
programs on your computer can read the data and present it in a human understandable way. For 
example, an audio file saved on the computer as a bunch of numbers needs to be played by the 
computer in a way that humans understand sound. Similarly, images, text etc should be presented on 
the computer screen in a way that human eyes can see it and their brain can understand it.
 Images
Natural images are typically saved in formats such as png, jpeg, jpg, tiff etc. Videos are typically 
saved as mpeg, mp4, mov etc. These are the popular formats in which images and videos taken over 
phones and cameras are saved. However, there are several other types of images such as medical 
images that have a special format such as svg, nii etc. Some of these images are in three dimensions 
and you need special programs to load and visualize them. 
 Audio
Audio files are saved in formats such as mp3, wav, au etc. There are standard programs that can 
read the audio files in this format and play them as sound using hardware such as speakers.
 Text
Text data is saved in formats such as doc, txt, rtf, log etc. One of the most popular formats is the 
word document format. In general, all the messages typed on phones, emails etc are saved in one 
of these formats.
 Tabular  Data
Tabular data can also be saved in 
formats such as txt. However, tabular 
data typically follows the structure 
of rows and columns. A very popular 
format is comma separated values (csv). 
Every row is in a new line. Each item 
in the row is separated by a comma. An 
example is shown in Figure 3.15. This 
type of data is very popularly used for 
training an AI.Data Type Format

Data for AI74We as humans can process different types of data in their native form. For example, images, 
sound, text etc do not need to be converted into another form for us to understand it. AIs on the 
other hand only understand numbers. In order to enable an AI to learn patterns in data, the data 
itself needs to be converted into numbers because AI can only understand numbers.
Images are composed of tiny little elements called pixels. You might have heard of the word 
pixels in the context of a camera. Cameras are described as having some fixed number of 
megapixels. For example, a camera might be 5 megapixels, which means it’s sensor can record 
5 million pixels. A 10 megapixel (MP) camera is more powerful than a 3 megapixel camera 
because it is much more detailed.
If we zoom into an image to look at its pixels, they look like Figure 3.24. Note how each block 
is filled with a single color. It turns out that each color in the pixel is represented by a number. In 
the case of gray scale images, a single number identifies the gray color . For example, 0 represents 
black and 1 represents white. All numbers in between represent a level of gray color as shown in 
Figure 3.22. Images
Sometimes, the grayness levels are represented by numbers between 0 and 255 instead of 0 and 
1. In a case where numbers are between 0 and 255, 0 represents black and 255 represents white 
color. An example is shown in Figure 3.23.Data Transformations

Modern cell phones can take pictures 
with 1-10 million pixels per picture 
(1-10 Megapixels). With three values 
(Red,Green Blue) per pixel, that is 
3 million to 30 million numbers per 
image! If an AI learns from a thousand 
images, it is studying from a billion to 
30 billion numbers!Did you know?


Data for AI 76An AI can only understand numbers 
and images are naturally represented 
by numbers assigned to each pixel 
and does not need transformation into 
numbers. Video data is an extension 
of the images data, where an image is 
recorded at diff  erent time intervals and 
when these images are shown on the 
screen one after that other at a rate of 
about 30 images per second, it forms a 
video with smooth motion
Audio
An audio signal can be represented as a string of numbers. Unlike images, where one can see the 
entire image in one shot, an audio signal is played over a period of time. Therefore, it is a series of 
numbers, where the number represents the sound at an instant of time. A series of these numbers 
over a period of time constitutes the audio clip. For example, a heat beat audio signal can look like 
Figure 3.26. Note that the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents the amplitude.
Figure 3.25 Color scale 
Figure 3.26 Plot of an audio signal
This is comparable to the color combinations you seen when mixing water colors. A range of colors 
can be created by mixing the basic colors, red, green and blue. Figure 3.25 illustrates the diff  erent 
color scales used by computers.In case of color images, there are three numbers that represent the color (Red, Green and Blue). A 
combination of these 3 numbers generates the color seen in a picture. For example if the pixel is 
represented by [255,0,0], it means the color of the pixel is pure red because green and blue channels 
are 0. Similarly, a combination of diff  erent numbers for the three colors represents diff  erent shades 
of all the colors seen on a screen.


77
Data for AI Data for AIFigure 3.25 Color scale Audio data is also represented as numbers. However, its structure is quite different from that of 
images. The audio signal is a series of numbers over a period of time, while images are a series 
of numbers in two dimensions with no time associated with it. A video is a series of images, 
where just like audio, time is a factor.
Text
Text data is represented by letters and an AI cannot understand letters and words. This type of data is 
converted into numbers. There are many ways to convert this data into numbers. In this section, one of 
the simplest ways to convert this data into a table of numbers is demonstrated. 
Take an example of two sentences in a dataset
I love dogs
I love cats and dogs
There are 5 unique words in the above example: (1) I (2) love (3) dogs (4) cats (5) and. These unique 
words are called the vocabulary of this dataset. Real world datasets have 1000s of words in their 
vocabulary. Since Figure 3.27 has a tiny dataset with only 2 sentences, the vocabulary is also small.
Assign a value 1 if the word from the vocabulary is present and a 0 if the word is not present. A 
conversion of the two sentences into a table of numbers looks like Figure 3.28
I love dogs cats and
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1Figure 3.27 Sample text data 
Figure 3.28 Converting sentences into numbers


Data for AI78An AI can understand data of the above form since it consists of only numbers. The above approach is 
popularly called the bag of words (BOW) approach.
Tables
Data in the form of tables can have numbers, sentences or categorical data in it. An example is shown 
in Figure 3.29.
Here, First Name  and Last Name  columns are not numerical. They are characters, but not full 
sentences. This type of data is called categorical data. Typically, you have a finite number of 
categories. If one of the columns contains text data, it would also need to be converted into 
numbers like the example shown in the previous section. Similarly, categorical data also needs 
to be converted into numbers. Again, there are several ways to do this depending on the type of 
categorical data. Categorical data can be of two types (a) Ordinal data (b) Nominal data. In the case 
of ordinal data, the categories have an inherent order. For example, if the categories are (i) very 
likely (ii) likely (iii) neural, there is an inherent order in these 3 categories. likely  is closer to very 
likely  than neutral . In such a case, simply encode the categories into numbers so that they follow 
this ordinal relationship. For example, 
very likely -> 0
likely -> 1
neutral -> 2ID No First Name Last Name Grade
156753 John Doe 5
145676 Maya Deren 3
196764 Aisha Sen 6
158766 Jane Doe 4
Figure 3.29 Sample tabular data


79
Data for AI Data for AIThe other type of data is the nominal data where there is no ordinal relationship. For example, the 
First Name  column in the above table. If the categories were to be encoded as:
John -> 0
Maya -> 1
Aisha -> 2
Jane -> 3
Is it reasonable to consider that Jane is closer to Aisha than John? 
The answer is, there is no such meaning or relationship between the numbers. However, the AI 
which consumes this data will imagine such a relationship. In order to avoid such mis-interpretation 
of data, another method of encoding categories into numbers called One Hot Encoding is followed.
In one hot encoding, first step is to determine the unique categories in the data. Consider a single 
column First Name  of the data shown in Figure 3.29. Each unique category becomes a new column 
with a binary encoding of 0 or 1 indicating whether this category is present or not. The table in 
Figure 2.30 below shows the encoding for a single column.
Remember that such encoding is needed for every categorical column in the data. Once all non-
numerical data in the table is converted into numbers, it is ready for an AI to learn from it and 
make predictions.John Maya Aisha Jane

Data for AI 80
Data analysis is an important aspect of building an AI. It is important to understand the data that will 
be given to the AI for making predictions. Analyzing the data helps to understand which type of AI to 
choose for a problem. In this section, basic tools to help us understand a dataset are discussed. 
Basic Sta�  s�  cs of Data
Statistics is a branch of 
mathematics that focuses 
on a scientifi  c way of 
collecting, analyzing 
and summarizing data. 
It is a way to draw valid 
conclusions about data.
For the purpose of explaining the basic statistics of data, 
table in Figure 3.32 is used as an example. This table has two 
columns Age and Grade. This dataset is described using basic 
statistics.Age Grade

Figure 3.31 Visualizing data
Figure 3.32 Sample numerical data
Sample size refers to the number of examples in data. In case of 
images, it refers to number of images, in case of tables, it refers to 
number of rows in the data.Concept
Sample
Size
The fi  rst term described is called Sample Size. Sample size is 
the number of examples in the data. For example, the sample 
size of Age in the above dataset is 4. This tells how much 
data is in the dataset. A larger dataset is considered better 
when training an AI.


81 Data for AI Data for AIMean value, also popularly called the average value, is another 
important statistic that provides insights about the data.Concept
Mean
Another set of important things to note about a dataset is the minimum and the maximum 
values. For example, the minimum value (also popularly referred to as the min value) for 
Age is 9 in the table in Figure 3.32. The maximum value (also popularly referred to as the 
max value) for Age is 12.
Mean value is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing it with the 
sample size. For example, adding all the values in the Age column results in 11+9+12+10 
= 42. Sample size is 4. The mean value is 42/4 = 10.5. Mean value is popularly 
represented by the symbol /uni03BC.
Standard deviation is a very popular statistic used to understand how spread out the data is 
with respect to the mean value. To calculate this statistic, two example datasets are used. 
They are also used to demonstrate how two datasets can have the same sample size, mean, 
max and min and yet have diff  erent standard deviation values.
First, standard deviation of the column Age in the table in Figure 3.32 is calculated. Mean 
value of this column has already been calculated and is equal to 10.5.Standard Devia�  on
Standard Deviation is a statistic that tells you how much your data 
deviates from the mean valueConcept

Calculate the diff  erence between each sample and the 
mean valueMean


Data for AI82Step  2:
Calculate the square of the difference between each sample 
and the mean valueAge (Age - μ) 2
11 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25
9 -1.5 x -1.5 = 2.25
12 1.5 x 1.5 = 2.25
10 -0.5x-0.5 = 0.25
10 -0.5 x -0.5 = 2.25
Age Age - μ
12 12-10.5 = 1.5
9 9-10.5 = -1.5
12 12-10.5 = 1.5
9 9-10.5 = -1.5Step  1:
Calculate the difference between each sample and the 
mean value . Step  3:
Calculate the mean of the value of the square of the difference between each sample and the 
mean value. This is  0.25 + 2.25 + 2.25 +0.25 = 5/4 = 1.25. Therefore, the standard deviation in 
case of table in Figure 3.32 is 1.25.

Figure 3.33 Sample numerical dataConsider another table shown in Figure 3.33. Same steps are followed to calculate the standard 
deviation of this table as well. The goal of calculating the standard deviation of this table is to show 
how two sets of data with same sample size and mean can have different standard deviation values.
Mean value is calculated by adding up all the values in the 
dataset and dividing it with the sample size. Adding all the 
values in the Age column in Figure 3.33 results in 12+9+12+9 = 
42. Sample size is 4. The mean value is 42/4 = 10.5. 


83 Data for AI Data for AIFigure 3.33 Sample numerical dataStep  3:
Calculate the mean of the value of the square of the diff  erence between each sample and the 
mean value. This can be calculated as 2.25 + 2.25 + 2.25 +2.25 = 10/4 = 2.25
The standard deviation in the second case is 2.25 which is higher than 1.25. This is because 
the deviation of data from the mean value is much higher in the second table than in the fi  rst 
one.
The spread of data across diff  erent numbers can be visualized using plots. This is a graphical 
way to visualize the data. Two types of plots (a) histograms and (b) bar plots are explored in 
this section.
A histogram is created that shows the spread of the data between 9 and 12. The fi  rst thing to pick when 
creating a histogram is how many bins it should have. For simplicity, assume the number of bins to be 
2. This results in division of the range between 9 and 12 into two equal parts. The fi  rst bin is from 9 
to (9+12)/2, which is 9-10.5 and the second bin is from 10.5-12. A histogram for this data with 2 bins 
would look like Figure 3.34.
Histograms
Histograms are used to visualize the spread of data between the minimum and 
maximum value. In Figure 3.32, column Age has the minimum and maximum value 
of 9 and 12.

9 -1.5 x -1.5 = 2.25
12 1.5 x 1.5 = 2.25
10 -1.5x-1.5 = 2.25
10 -0.5 x -0.5 = 2.25


Data for AI 84For the same example, if the number of bins is 3, the data between 9 and 12 is divided 
into 3 equal parts (i)9-10 (ii)10-11 and (iii)11-12 . A histogram for the data with 3 bins 
would look like the fi  gure below.
In the real world, the datasets are much bigger and a histogram visualizes the spread 
of data. It shows how many samples are there in certain ranges of the data. This plot is 
used to understand if a certain range has more samples than the other.
A bar plot for this table that records the frequency of each category is shown in Figure 3.37.Bar Plots
Bar plots are used when there are a fi  nite number of categories. For example, in the 
table above, Grade can be assumed to be a categorical column with 3 unique values 3, 
5 and 6. The number of times each category occurs is called frequency.
A table that counts the occurrence of each unique category is shown in Figure 3.36.

Bar plots help understand how often each category occurs in the data. It is very useful to 
know this information. This information is used to make decisions on how to process the 
data so that an AI can learn from it properly.
Sca�  er Plots
Scatter plots are used to see how two columns of data relate to each other. In a scatter plot there 
are two axis: X and Y . One of the columns is chosen as X and the other is chosen as Y . Then a 
dot is placed for every data point to match the X value and the Y value. Visualizing the pattern 
of dots helps understand how the two columns relate to each other.
The above table shows a dataset that compares student test scores with their age. The scatter plot 
shows that test scores increase with age. This is an example of the type of insight that a scatter 
plot can provide.Figure 3.37 Bar Plots
Figure 3.38 Scatter Plots


Data for AI 86Data Stories
It has been well established in this chapter that data is crucial to AI and it can come in many forms. 
Analyzing data is important to fi  nd out what is in the data and decide how to best prepare the data for 
training an AI. This section discusses an important related topic, Data Stories. 
Every dataset tells a story. Why should this story be extracted and who is it for? Data Stories are 
frequently developed by data scientists, analysts or other engineers that work with the data. The 
purpose of a Data Story is to describe what the data is and what it tells us. Even before an AI can 
extract hidden insights from the data, humans can examine the data and fi  nd (possibly more obvious) 
insights using the analysis, statistics and approaches seen in the past few sections of this chapter. 
Further, the insights that the AI extracts can also be added to the story.
 Good Storytelling - Know your Audience
Good storytelling has a few elements. The fi  rst 
- know who the audience is and what they care 
about. The point of a data story is to share with 
the audience, learnings from the data. What 
does the audience want to know? For example, 
if the audience is the CEO of the company, 
they may be more interested in high level 
items like how much money the company has 
made, rather than more deep details like how 
a particular feature of a product is doing. The 
person managing that product, however, may 
be far more interested in the second piece of 
information!
Data stories communicate important insights from the data to other 
people. Data stories help everyone who cares about the data to 
understand what the data is telling them.Concept
Data 
Stories
Figure 3.39


87 Data for AI Data for AI Good Storytelling - Answer Ques�  ons
Sharing details may be fun, but ultimately, data 
stories need to answer questions in order to be 
useful. Think of what questions the data can 
answer, and then also what questions the audience 
would like to see answers to! For example, the 
CEO may want to know if the company made 
more money this year than last year, while a 
person who works on a product may want to 
know if the customers like the new version of the 
product more than the old one. 
 Good Storytelling - Use Powerful Visuals
Data can be boring, but answers to questions  are 
not. When telling a data story, visuals help the 
audience understand what the data is telling. In the 
previous sections of this chapter, diff  erent types of 
graphs and tables were covered. These can be used 
to decide the right type of visual for the data story. 
It is possible that the data story will have more than 
one type of visual.
Why Data Stories MatterWhy Data Stories Matter
When an AI is built inside a corporation, it is created 
to solve a problem. As such, many people in the 
company will care about how the AI is expected to 
solve the problem (these people are usually called 
Stakeholders ). Many of these people will not be 
engineers or computer scientists. Data stories are 
essential to help them understand why the AI is 
expected to work, which in turn is essential to get 
their support.Of course the data may not be able to answer all questions, but a key part of a good story is fi  nding 
the questions that the audience cares about that the data can in fact answer.Figure 3.40

In this exercise, a data story is explored. Figure 3.43 shows a public dataset about US 
basketball players (NBA Players). 
The fi  rst thing to notice is that the dataset tells details about diff  erent players, starting with 
their name and continuing with what team they play for, their jersey number, their position, 
their age, height, weight, and fi  nally the college they graduated from and how much money 
they make.

 Good Storytelling - What are the Ques�  ons?
What questions can be answered from this data? Here are a few examples
- Which teams pay more?
- How old are the players?
- Does age aff  ect your salary?
These are not the only questions. Others can include whether height aff  ects salary, whether 
some colleges send more players to the NBA than others, whether players from some 
colleges earn more in salary, whether weight matters, and so on. For this example, focus on 
the three questions listed above.Figure 3.43 NBA players dataset

Data for AI 90Data Preparation 
(Feature Engineering)
As seen in previous sections in the chapter, data can come in many forms (text, images, etc.). 
However, all AI programs deal only with numbers. Before an AI can learn from the data, every 
data type must be converted to a number. This is one of many steps that are needed to Prepare the 
Data before an AI trains. This step is a very important part of real-world AI, and is called Data 
Preparation, Feature Engineering , or simply Data Cleaning. In this chapter, we will call it Feature 
Engineering .
Feature Engineering can involve many steps. Some steps are essential, in that the AI training will 
not work at all without them, and some steps are optimizations, in that the AI will work without these 
steps but will likely work better (for example with higher accuracy) if these steps are performed.
Required Feature Engineering Steps
Some required feature engineering steps include
1. Converting every feature to numbers. There are specifi  c ways that any data type can be 
converted to a number. We will not explore this much here, but you will learn about it if you 
study more AI.
2. Removing missing values. Real world data can have missing values. These need to be either 
fi  lled in or removed before the AI can learn.
3. Convert all labels to numbersReminder: Features and Labels
Quick reminder - data can have 
Features and Labels. Features are the 
information that the AI learns patterns 
about. In supervised learning (where 
the right answer is given) the answer is 
the Label. Unsupervised learning does 
not have labels.
Feature engineering has required steps 
for both Features and Labels.
Figures 3.47 Features, Labels and Sample


91 Data for AI Data for AIFeature Engineering Op�  miza�  ons
There are many feature engineering optimizations 
that can help an AI perform better. Some examples 
are described in this section
1. Removing unnecessary features. If the data 
scientist knows that some features will not help the 
AI learn anything useful, removing them can help 
the AI focus, as well as take less time to train
2. Transforming features. For example, for many 
algorithms, normalizing a feature (dividing each 
value by a maximum so that the range is fi  xed) can 
help. 
3. Creating new features (also called Feature 
Synthesis). For example, if the data already has 
distance and time, creating a new feature called 
Speed (Distance/Time) can help the AI if the pattern 
it needs to learn is dependent on speed.That many data scientists spend 
more time preparing the data 
than actually training the AI?

the most complex and important 
steps in real world AI.Did you know?

Engineering
Feature engineering is conducted to give the AI algorithm a better shot at 
learning the patterns in data. Some feature engineering is required, others 
are optional but important for performance.Real-world data is frequently considered Dirty. 
This is why feature engineering is often called 
Data Cleaning . Why is real data called Dirty? It 
is because data gathered from real sources can 
frequently have mistakes, missing values, or 
format errors. For example - if data is gathered 
from a sensor, there can be missing values if the 
sensor was turned off  . If data is gathered from a 
video camera and the camera had dirt or water on 
the lens, the images can be poor quality.

Data for AI 92
Example: Electric VehiclesExample: Electric Vehicles
In this example, feature engineering on a real dataset is explored. This dataset is about electric 
vehicles. A sample of the dataset is shown in Figure 3.48.
A quick examination of this dataset shows that it contains eight columns. Assume the AI needs to 
predict the price of the car (Column 8 - PriceEuro), then there are seven features and one label. Note 
that one of the features is a category (Column 6, which has two values AWD - All Wheel Drive or 
RWD - Front Wheel Drive).  This column will need to be converted to numbers. Some entries in 
the columns are N/A (Not Available). These will need to be fi  xed. These two are required Feature 
Engineering  steps. 
Once AWD  and RWD  are converted to numbers, new table look like Figure 3.49. The PowerTrain
column has been replaced with two columns - PowerTrain-AWD and PowerTrain RWD. If the 
original row had AWD  - there would now be a 1 in PowerTrain AWD and 0 in PowerTrain RWD . 
This conversion is a process called One Hot Encoding  which was covered earlier in this chapter.
Next step is to remove the N/As. There are many ways to do this. One simple way is to just 
remove the rows that contain N/A in any column. The other way is to fi  ll in the N/A with some 
value - like the average value for the column, or the most common value for the column. All these 
options are ok - usually, data scientists experiment with them to decide on the best one. In his 
example, rows are simply removed.

With these steps, the above dataset is ready for an AI to train (all required steps are done). 
However, it is possible to do more. For example, the columns that have acceleration time 
(AccelSec ) and seats (Seats) have much smaller values than the other columns. One option is to 
normalize all the columns so that all numbers have values between 0 and 1. If this is done, the 
dataset will look like the below. 
So, did the optional normalization step help? It depends on what AI algorithm is used. Later in 
this book, two algorithms, Linear Regression and K Nearest Neighbors are described. Both can be 
used for this problem. The table below shows how well the fi  rst dataset (without normalization) 
and the second dataset (with normalization), did for both algorithms.
The goal is to get the lowest error (note that the concept of error is explained in later chapters). 
For now, the only things to notice are:
- Both algorithms benefi  ted from Normalization
- K Nearest Neighbors benefi  ted more
- Without Normalization, Linear Regression did better, but with Normalization, K Nearest 
Neighbors did better. So, feature engineering  can actually change which AI does better!

Data for AI 94Putting it all together
What have we learned in this chapter?
We have learned that data is crucial to AI, and that data can come in many forms. 
We have also learned that AI’s ability to make sense of data is one of the reasons why it has 
become so valuable to so many industries in the world.
Data scientists play a crucial role in helping us (and the AIs!) make sense of data. Their job 
involves many aspects of data, from gathering the initial data, to doing Data Analysis and 
building Data Stories, to deciding what feature engineering to perform. All of these can make 
the diff  erence between whether AI works well or not.
Where can I get data for my AI projects? 
The good news is that there are a lot of public datasets available now. You can use these to 
study AI and even build your own highly sophisticated projects. 
Some examples of where to get data

Data for AI 110Teachers Corner
Core Concepts
In this chapter, students explore data - a critical component of any AI. The core concepts 
that students should appreciate are:
• Data is all around us
• Data comes in many diff  erent types - such as text, audio, video, numbers, etc.
• Understanding and selecting the right data is a critical part of building a good AI. Data 
analysis (where humans or other programs explore the data) is an important step before 
data is fed into an AI.
• Data needs to be transformed before it can be used in an AI. AIs only read numbers, so 
every type of data eventually becomes a series of numbers. 
• AIs can understand complex data, but for real-world problems to be solved, humans 
need to understand at least part of the data. This is where data storytelling comes into 
play.
• Data analysis requires statistics and visualization.
Grade Level Alignment
The core concepts of data and its role in the AI life cycle are accessible to all grade levels 
in Middle School and High School. The data analysis section is more suitable for grades 
7 and above. Students in grades 10 and above should already know the basic statistics - so 
teachers can focus on the application of these in Data Science.
The chapter also contains a series of Python examples. These are suitable for students with a 
working knowledge of Python, independent of grade level.
Some �  ps for discussions when teaching this chapter:
• Depending on your focus, you can decide whether to integrate the coding elements or 
not. For example - if you are focusing on STEM overviews or AI use in Science, then 
the coding exercises may not be necessary. If you are teaching AI as part of a Computer 
Science course, then we recommend the coding exercises.
• The coding exercises in this chapter are all in Python. They require the students to 
understand the following Python concepts
          - Input/Output
          - Modules


111 Data for AI Data for AITeachers Corner Teachers Corner
          - Loops and Conditionals.
          - Try/Catch error handling
       If you need to teach these concepts, please see the curriculum listed below.
• There are many exercises that students can do oﬄ   ine (unplugged) that can help them 
appreciate how to analyze data. A simple exercise can be to ask them to note down what 
time they go to sleep every night. After about 2 weeks, they can analyze this data and 
see (a) does it diff  er between weeknights and weekends, and (b) what is the average 
time they go to bed.

AI Ethics AI Ethics
CHAPTER 
4AI Ethics
As AI becomes more pervasive, its interaction with humans increases. AI 
is being used in everything from disease detection to loan approvals. As 
such, it becomes imperative that the technology, regardless of its promise, is 
developed in a safe way that protects humans and the planet. In short, AIs 
should behave in a way that reflects the values of the human societies that use 
the AIs. This chapter covers AI Ethics,  a critical learning component for all 
students studying AI.


AI Ethics 114
What makes AI Ethics hard
While most humans and governments agree that AI Ethics is important, what exactly to do about it is 
a diﬃ   cult problem. There are many reasons for this. The ﬁ  rst is that not all humans agree on aspects 
of human ethics. For example - do all humans agree on what is fair? They do not. If some people get 
better opportunities than others - is that fair? Does it depend on the circumstance? Each human society 
has its own values, and these values often evolve with time. As such, it is diﬃ   cult for an AI to do what 
is right, if humans cannot agree on what that is.
The second reason why AI Ethics is hard is that it is a multi-faceted topic. There are many aspects to 
AI Ethics. This chapter covers several of them
1. AI Bias: AI Bias is the area of AI Ethics focused on ensuring that AIs do not discriminate against 
minorities or under-represented populations.
2. AI and Privacy: Since AI relies upon data and information, a key focus is to ensure that AIs do not 
violate the privacy of the individuals that they learn about.
3. Deepfakes and Misinformation: AIs can create realistic looking images,videos and other content 
that can be used for misinformation and fraud.
4. AI and the Environment: As larger and larger AIs get built, they consume massive amounts of 
compute resources. Ethics are needed to ensure that the impact on the environment is managed.
5. AI and Access: Virtually every country in the world now considers AI to be critical for staying 
competitive in the future. This means that countries that lack access to AI data or ways to train AI 
skills could get even further behind economically. Ethics are needed to ensure equitable access to AI 
technology and AI powered resources.
Context: Why should we care about AI Ethics?Context: Why should we care about AI Ethics?
Say that an AI tracks an individual’s shopping habits and recommends foods for them to buy. Is 
that an acceptable use of their information? What if the same AI realizes that the individual has 
back pain (because they bought medicine), and their health insurance provider charges them 
more because provider now knows that the person has back pain. Is that acceptable?
Say that an AI learns about a person from their social media history and a bank uses that 
information to deny the person a car loan because they think that he or she is not responsible. 
Is that ok?
As these examples show, AI has the ability to 
learn a lot about humans (sometimes even more 
than theirs friends or family know). Every person 
will have a diﬀ  erent level of comfort about this. 
Hopefully these examples illustrate why societies 
and individuals should all care about AI Ethics.

AI Ethics is everyone’s responsibility
Ensuring good AI Ethics is everyone’s responsibility. So what can we all do?
Governments are starting to develop laws and guidelines to help corporations and others develop 
ethical AIs. These include
- Laws about how people’s private information is used
- Laws about how AIs that aﬀ  ect people are monitored, reviewed and approved before they are used. 
Both governments and public organizations are helping raise awareness of AI Ethics and why it 
matters.
Governments, corporations and public organizations are democratizing access to AI resources and 
datasets to help people in all countries develop AI competence. 
What can individuals do? Every person can contribute to an ethical AI future  by doing the following:
- Learn about AI Ethics (that is what this chapter is for!). This chapter covers each aspect of AI 
Ethics in turn. Each section examines the challenges of building ethical AIs and  the best practices 
to apply when learning and practicing AI.
- Learn how to build safe and responsible AIs. See the exercises at the end of this chapter to develop 
hands on capabilities to build ethical AIs
Context: How to make AIs safeContext: How to make AIs safe
Say that a school is using AI to decide what 
subjects students should learn. This AI has 
been trained on a lot of boys but does not 
know much about how girls learn. This AI 
then mistakenly decides that a girl is not 
good at math, because her learning pattern is 
not what the AI expects. Is this acceptable? 
Certainly not. But how can one ensure that 
this does not happen? 
Who needs to understand the AI and what do they need to know about the AI? Does the math 
teacher need to understand how the AI works? Does the school principal? If such an AI makes 
mistakes, how can a user tell?  These are some of the challenges of building safe AIs that do not 
discriminate.Figure 4.2 Student learning maths

AI Ethics 116
 AI Ethics

One of the most discussed aspects of AI Ethics is that of Bias - ensuring that AIs are not discriminating 
against minorities or other underrepresented groups.  Discrimination can come in many forms. The 
most obvious example is if an AI approves beneﬁ  ts for some groups and not others (for example, if 
loans are approved for men but not women, or loans are approved for Caucasians but not African 
Americans where every other attribute is similar.) However, bias is not limited to granting of 
beneﬁ  ts. For example, if an AI trained to detect disease works with higher accuracy for some ethnic 
groups, that is also bias.
The ﬁ  rst step to understanding how to prevent AI Bias is to understand how AI Bias can manifest.
AI Bias
AIs are not natively biased. Bias is a human attribute that AIs can learn. As previous chapters  
have already covered,  AIs learn from data. Through the data and the AI life cycle, AIs become 
structured to solve problems as deﬁ  ned by human creators. During an AI’s creation, there are 
many points at which humans can inadvertently pass bias to an AI. They include Data, Problem 
Deﬁ  nition, and more.How Bias Enters an AI

Take a moment to review the image in 
Figure 4.3. What does the image show?
When this image was shown to large 
audiences, each individual saw diﬀ  erent 
things in the image. Some believed it was 
a school graduation. Others thought it 
was a concert or picnic. Some thought it 
was a sporting event, and others thought 
it was a protest. This image is in fact of 
a protest in Ferguson, Missouri in the 
United States in 2017. 
REFERENCE IMAGE SOURCE - https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/image/peaceful-protest-fergusonWhat this exercise illustrates is that, in the absence of information, every human brings their own 
perspective and interpretation to information. Since AIs lack perspectives of their own, they learn 
the perspectives passed on to them by their human creators. 
The ﬁ  rst step to mitigating AI Bias is to understand what bias we as humans are providing to the 
AIs that we create.Figure 4.3 Assessing the information on labels

Bias in Data
Historical data is frequently biased, refl  ecting biases in human history that we do not want to see 
repeated. If historical data is given unmodiﬁ  ed to the AI, the AI will learn these  biases. For example, 
if an AI  is trained with historical data of car loan approvals from the US, with all customer attributes 
including race and gender, that AI would likely learn that only middle aged Caucasian men should get 
car loans. The AI will learn what was likely the historical approval pattern. To force the AI to consider 
acceptable  attributes like credit rating or payment history, the AI’s creators would need to explicitly 
exclude the attributes that they do not want  to be considered.

Figure 4.4 shows a (ﬁ  ctional) dataset of car 
loan approvals. Visually examine this dataset. 
What patterns can be observed?
The ﬁ  rst observation that most men have had 
their car loans approved. Very few approvals 
have gone to women and those to women of 
higher income. If this dataset is used to train 
an AI, what will it learn? 
We trained an AI on this dataset and it decided 
that the gender of the applicant was the most 
important feature, and that income was less 
important. See Table 4.5 for the AI’s priorities.
Figure 4.4
Figure 4.5Figure 4.5 shows a table with each feature of the 
dataset and a number in the column Value that 
indicates how important the feature is. A large 
number indicates that the feature is relatively 
more important. As the table shows, the most 
important criteria the AI considers is whether the 
applicant is female. This is a clear case of bias.
Context


AI Ethics 118Data is not the only way that bias can enter an AI. Another important area is problem deﬁ  nition. Note 
that AIs only solve the problem as it is deﬁ  ned by humans. They have no ability to expand the problem 
deﬁ  nition. For example, if a practitioner trains an AI to recommend the best teenager book for a user, it 
has no ability to recommend an adult book or elementary book. This is because it has been deﬁ  ned to 
not serve other user groups. If the human deﬁ  ning the problem believes the AI is not expected to serve 
a certain user group - it will by deﬁ  nition not be able to.
How does one avoid bias in problem deﬁ  ni�  on?
- The key is to examine the problem deﬁ  nition and consider  if this is the only way to state the problem 
or whether the  human has added their own perspective of the problem.
- Note that, sometimes, adding human  perspective is ok! For example, if a practitioner is an expert 
on the domain, they can make life easier for an AI by simplifying the problem. Lets take the example 
above. If the practitioner knows for sure that their customers want only teenager books, there is no 
need to confuse the AI by giving it options of elementary books or books for adults.
- Consider all the ways that the AI can be used and make sure the problem deﬁ  nition supports all the 
usage models.
- Once the AI is ready, it is important to give it to as many variants of the intended user group as 
possible. Then the practitioner can follow up with the users and ask them whether the AI gave them 
helpful answers. If the AI did not give helpful answers to a notable subset of the users, it is possible 
that a better problem deﬁ  nition will help.Bias in Problem Deﬁ  ni�  on
Key thing to know Key thing to know 
Most AIs do not have any perspective or common sense that humans have. There are researchers 
looking at ways to give AI common sense, but for now, remember that an AI only knows what 
it has learned from the data the human creator has given it.
An AI will take the shortest path to high accuracy. If that path runs through bias, or patterns in 
the data that humans are not even aware of, that pattern is what the AI is likely to discover and 
exploit. Sometimes these patterns may not even be visible to humans, but since AI algorithms 
specialize in pattern discovery, an AI can frequently discover hidden patterns that humans 
inspecting the data may not see.

Problem Defi  nition Bias in Real WorldProblem Defi  nition Bias in Real World
Below is a very common illustration to help new AI practitioners understand how important it 
is to deﬁ  ne the problem precisely and ensure that the AI understood the problem the way the 
human intended. Figure 4.6 shows 10 images of animals, 5 huskies (a type of dog) and 5 wolves. 
The AI was asked to distinguish between Husky and Wolf. 
Examine the images. What distinguishing characteristics do you believe the AI learned?
The images framed in yellow are the AI’s predictions for huskies, and the images framed in 
orange the prediction for wolves. The AI only got one prediction wrong - the one with the X. 
The AI predicted husky when it should have been wolf.
By examining the internals of the AI, it was discovered that the AI only learned to look for snow 
in the image and ignored the animals completely. The only mis prediction occurred because the 
wolf was in snow. The critical item to note is the diﬀ  erence between the question that the human 
thought they were asking and the question the AI actually processed. To the human, naming the 
categories as Husky and Wolf has meaning. Since the human is aware these are both animals, our 
attention automatically goes to the animals. To the AI however the terms Husky and Wolf have no 
meaning, they are just character strings. The AI understood the question to be to determine what 
characteristics best distinguish the images (collections of pixels) in category 1 and the collections 
of pixels in category 2. It found the presence of snow to be the easiest distinguishing factor and did 
not need to consider other details to get a good accuracy.

AI Ethics 120
Example: How race can manifest in unexpected waysExample: How race can manifest in unexpected ways
Say that an AI designer wants to ensure that an AI that reviews resumes is not biased by an 
applicant’s race. The ﬁ  rst step would certainly be to ensure that the applicant’s race is not listed 
anywhere in the resume. But is this enough?
Unfortunately, no. If the applicant’s address is on the resume, it is very possible that, given 
people’s nature to live in communities ethnically similar to their own, that an AI can ﬁ  nd a 
correlation between an address and an ethnic group.
If the AI designer removes all addresses, ss that enough? Unfortunately no. The school that the 
person went to, the state and country,  can also indicate information about their ethnicity. Even 
if that is removed, the way the person chose to describe themselves in the resume, the language 
phrases used, etc. can indicate where they grew up or where they went to school.
As this example shows, removing patterns from data is very diﬃ   cult. It is very possible for 
AIs to discover patterns in data that the humans were not even aware of. Given this, the task of 
mitigating bias is very challenging.Given that  AIs can learn bias, wouldn’t the answer simply be to remove ﬁ  elds like race and gender 
from all datasets? Unfortunately, it is not quite so simple. There can be hidden patterns in data that 
humans may not be aware of, but that the AI will ﬁ  nd. Those patterns can be biases. When these 
patterns are acceptable - we call them insights and this is in fact what we use AI for! However, 
when these patterns are not acceptable, we call them Bias and they need to be removed.Unexpected Manifesta�  ons of Bias

121 AI Ethics AI EthicsProblems Caused by Bias
Bias in AI can do damage to both individuals and corporations. If a company is found to have created and 
used a biased AI - it can damage their reputation, cause customers to leave and cause other customers and 
employees to lose trust.  People aﬀ  ected by the bias may even initiate lawsuits against the corporation.
We have already seen how bias can aﬀ  ect individuals, by denying them beneﬁ  ts. Bias can also cause 
less visible damage. For example, if a digital assistant is trained on mostly voice data from one ethnic 
group, it is less likely to understand voice commands from customers with a diﬀ  erent accent. The 
underrepresented customer group would get poorer service from the assistant and the company building 
the assistant would have a less competitive product among these groups.

Example: Case Study - ACLU Facial Recognition LawsuitExample: Case Study - ACLU Facial Recognition Lawsuit
In April 2021, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), jointly with other organizations, 
ﬁ  led a federal lawsuit on behalf of an African American man, Robert Williams, who had been 
arrested by the Detroit police based on a faulty facial recognition match. 
The lawsuit alleges that facial recognition has a long history of bias against minorities, and 
that the speciﬁ  c incident with Mr. Williams is the result of such AI Bias. 
As AI becomes more prevalent, issues like this are particularly concerning for citizens and 
governments alike. As of early 2022, several cities and states across the United States have 
banned the use of facial recognition by their police departments.

123 AI Ethics AI EthicsMi�  ga�  ng Bias
As already discussed, bias is a diﬃ   cult problem to solve. The AIs themselves are not natively biased, 
but the skill that AI algorithms have in detecting patterns makes them particularly susceptible to 
learning bias from humans, whether from historical data or from unconscious biases in the humans that 
create the AIs. Bias mitigation is still an active area of research. Some of common approaches being 
used today to mitigate bias include:
- Education: The ﬁ  rst step is to make sure that everyone who creates or uses and AI is aware of AI’s 
susceptibility to bias. This includes training data scientists and AI engineers to check data for sources 
of bias, and to review problem deﬁ  nitions to avoid bias.
- Testing: Real-world AI systems can be very complex, using thousands of features and millions 
or hundreds of millions of data samples. In such complex AIs, it is not possible to remove bias by 
inspection alone. A common practice is to test for bias, for example by providing the AI to many groups 
of users who diﬀ  er in ethnic or similar attributes. If the AI behaves diﬀ  erent between these groups, it is 
likely that bias has crept in somewhere.
- Explainability: Some AI algorithms are capable of providing a rationale for their predictions. Such 
rationales are valuable to understand how the AI came to its decision and can be a very useful tool to 
ﬁ  ght bias. As such, some legally sensitive industries (such as Finance) are placing high importance on 
explainable algorithms and laws are starting to (at least implicitly) demand explainable algorithms in 
regulated industries. However, many AI algorithms are yet not explainable, so the challenge persists.
The United States Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) is  attempting 
to use existing consumer protection 
laws to regulate AI. Since these laws 
already prohibit unfair practices that 
target consumers based on ethnicity 
and such, the FTC is using them to 
prevent unexplainable algorithms 
from being used in industries 
governed by such laws.  Example: Legislation to mitigate biasExample: Legislation to mitigate bias

AI Ethics 124Another important area of AI Ethics is Privacy. AI thrives on data. Companies and governments are 
able to use AI to gather insights about people and behavior from data, thereby motivating them to 
gather even more data about people. As this cycle continues, both individuals and governments are 
expressing concern about the invasion of privacy. How much and what types of data are acceptable for 
use in an AI? Would an average individual know what information is being gathered about them and 
how it is being used to make decisions that aﬀ  ect them? What rights do individuals have to be informed 
about access to and use of information about their lives?
To illustrate this concern, consider the following scenarios 
- In many countries, grocery stores oﬀ  er a rewards program where a customer gets discounts on common 
items. In return, the customer is expected to use their rewards card for all purchases, implying that the 
store can now track purchasing habits for everyday goods. This information can be used by the store to 
determine if a customer is in ill health, if their hereditary patterns change, what desserts they like, etc. 
Some users will ﬁ  nd this acceptable and others will not. 
- In many countries, video cameras can be found in public spaces. Coupled with face recognition, these 
cameras can be used to track individuals as they walk down the street. In the hands of police, they can 
be used to investigate crimes.
- Digital assistants in our homes have AIs trained to respond to commands directed at them by name such 
as Hey Google, Alexa or Hey Siri. In order to detect their name, they must listen to every audio input in 
the vicinity and process it to look for their name. This implies that they are doing some processing on 
everything going on in the home they are in.
- Manufacturers of beds are now developing advanced bed technologies where sensors in the bed tracks 
human breathing sounds and use AI to detect diseases such as fl  u and cold before the user is aware of 
them. Some individuals will consider this a serious privacy violation.
AI and Privacy
Case study: What does a mega store know about a user?Case study: What does a mega store know about a user?
Lets do a hypothetical exercise. If a person buys clothing and everyday items from a store and 
also rent movies from them, or buy books from them, what could the store know about the 
customer? Below are a list of things the store could know
- Customer’s address (to ship the items)
- How many and what rough ages of people live in the customer’s home (if they buy clothes for 
everyone)
- Birthdays (if they buy party supplies at the same time every year)
- Whether the customer is losing weight (did their clothes’ size change?)
- Whether the customer has back pain (did they buy over the counter painkillers?)
- The customer’s relatives’ addresses (if they were sent gifts?)
- What movies and books the customer likes/
- Whether the family is expecting a new baby (buy baby books, diapers, baby toys?)
And more. These companies know a lot about their users.
Context


125 AI Ethics AI EthicsIndividuals have varying degrees of discomfort about privacy. For example, one person may feel that the 
use of a rewards card in a grocery store is acceptable while a bed tracking their sleep sounds is not. The 
challenges of privacy and AI come from this very fact - that there is no standard on what is acceptable. 
Because of this, each individual has a right to determine what they consider to be private, and then will 
need to determine if their sense of privacy has been violated. Many of the laws being proposed are about 
giving each individual that right.
Case study: AI and the CCPACase study: AI and the CCPAProtec�  ng Privacy in the Age of AI
There are several techniques that are now being used to protect a person’s privacy in the age of AI. 
They include laws that govern how companies can use consumer information in algorithms. Great 
examples are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, and the 
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in California in the United States. Such laws have provisions 
that not only regulate how customer data can be acquired, but also provide consumers with a “Right to 
Explanation”, implying that companies that use AIs that learn from consumer information may need 
to explain to customers how their data was used to make decisions and how each decision aﬀ  ected the 
customer.
- Right to be informed: Consumers have a right to know 
what data about them is being used for.
- Right to deletion: If a consumer asks for data about them 
to be deleted, the company must do so.
- Right to Opt Out: Consumers can ask for their data to be 
used for no other reason than whatever the business is. For 
example - if one ordered a book, the bookstore clearly needs 
to know that the customer ordered the book in order to 
deliver it. However, if the customer opted-out, the bookstore 
should not use this information for any other reasons, like 
training an AI to recommend books to them or anyone else.
- Right of Access: Consumers should be able to access data about them.
To meet these requirements, companies have to carefully track all consumer information being used 
in an AI, and make sure all these requirements can be met.
At the time of this book’s writing, the California Consumer 
Privacy Act (CCPA) is one of the most comprehensive 
pieces of legislation passed in the United States on behalf 
of consumer privacy. Similar legislation is occurring in 
other countries around the world. These laws have several 
important implications for AI: 
Figures 4.11 Case study on CCPA
Context


AI Ethics 126Other techniques that can protect a user’s privacy in the presence of AIs are:
- Anonymized data: This means that the customer cannot be identiﬁ  ed in any way based on the 
information that the AI uses. A great example is medical data. Medical data (like MRI scans or XRays) 
are very useful for training AI’s to detect diseases. There is no need for the patient’s name to be 
included in the MRI information. The AI has no use for the name. By giving the patient an ID (like a 
number), it is possible to get useful data for an AI while protecting the user’s privacy. If the dataset is 
more complex, more eﬀ  ort may be needed to anonymize it. For example, even if one deleted the user’s 
name, if their birth date was kept, that could be enough to identify the user?. In that case, it may be 
better keep the user’s age when the data was taken, but not the date when the data was taken - so that 
the birth date cannot be derived.
-  Synthetic data: Synthetic data is fake data. It may sound strange, but AIs are actually quite good 
at generating fake data! If one AI can generate data to train another AI, no user will even need to 
be involved. AIs are not the only way to generate synthetic data however. There are also statistical 
methods that can generate synthetic data.
- Diﬀ  erential Privacy: This is a method for creating datasets that contain useful information for AIs 
and other uses, but does not contain enough information to identify any individual user. For example, 
if the dataset contains statistics about a large user base, that could still be useful without exposing any 
individual and their details.
Case study: How AI Creates Synthetic Data!Case study: How AI Creates Synthetic Data!
Oddly enough, the same AI techniques that can create 
realistic Deep Fakes can also create Synthetic Data! If an 
AI is given enough examples of, say, an X-Ray of people 
with COVID-19, it can learn how COVID-19 manifests 
in X-Rays. Once it knows this, it can create realistic 
looking X-Rays for ﬁ  ctional COVID-19 patients. These 
images, in turn, can be used to train other AIs to detect 
COVID-19.
Till recently, the AIs that can generate these types of 
synthetic data (called Generative Adversarial Networks, 
or GANs) have been very expensive to train. However, 
with recent advances by companies such as NVidia and 
universities like MIT, these networks are becoming 
much cheaper to train eﬀ  ectively. This in turn can make 
Synthetic Data more of a reality.

Case study: Synthetic Data for Self Driving Cars!Case study: Synthetic Data for Self Driving Cars!
Self Driving cars create many privacy concerns. For 
example self driving cars need to use the on board 
cameras to see the road around them and make localized 
decisions. To train such an AI requires lots of images 
and video examples of road conditions. These can 
violate the privacy of any individual on the road. 
So far, this chapter has focused on the techniques that are being used to grant individuals either 
anonymity or greater visibility and control over how organizations use their personal data. The ﬁ  nal 
item we will cover in AI and Privacy is the fl  ip side of this eﬀ  ort. It is very clear that data has value and 
that AI can help extract that value. But who does the value belong to? Even if laws help an individual 
control what companies do with their data, one can argue that the private data is the property of an 
individual, and as such companies’ use of it should not just be controlled, but rather that individuals 
should be compensated for the use of their data.
Enter data marketplaces. These are venues where individuals can sell their personal data, which is 
then aggregated into data products that corporations can purchase. Data marketplaces are growing 
rapidly as everyone realizes the value of data in the age of AI.REFERENCE SOURCE - https://apollo.auto/synthetic.htmlEnter simulators! Rather than training the car’s AI only on real pictures of roads, the AI can also be 
trained using simulators. Simulators can create realistic looking images of any driving condition that 
the car needs to learn. In addition to protecting the privacy of real people on real roads, simulated 
road scenes have other advantages. The simulation can create any situation no matter how rare. 
For example, one can take real street videos for years and never come across a video of someone 
throwing paint at a car. However, with a simulation, creating visuals for this scenario is trivial!Figure 4.13 Scenic road to drive on

AI Ethics 128
DeepFakes and Misinformation
The last section noted that AIs can generate Synthetic Data. The same types of AIs that create Synthetic 
data can also be used to create other types of Fakes. These are called Deep Fakes and can be used for 
many illegal purposes, such as misinformation and fraud.
Imagine if an AI can create a picture or a video of a human that is completely fake, but is very hard 
to distinguish from an actual picture or video of that person. What kinds of harm can this cause? It is 
possible that the fake video shows the person robbing a store. That video can be used to put the person 
in prison, or ruin their reputation. Looking at it another way, if AIs can create fake videos or pictures 
that look very real, how do societies trust actual pictures and videos? If a store records a video of a 
person committing an actual robbery, the person can always claim that the video is fake. 
These kinds of DeepFakes are becoming a serious problem for society. They can be used to create fake 
news, defraud people and companies, and incite violence. As AIs become more proﬁ  cient at creating 
DeepFakes, technologists and researchers are also looking for more and more advanced ways to detect 
DeepFakes, also frequently using AI. 
Case study: Which Person is Real?Case study: Which Person is Real?
Check out the pictures here. Which of these people 
is real? 
It turns out none of them are! All of these faces 
are generated by an AI type called Generative 
Adversarial Neural Networks (or GANs).
Can one tell that the people are fake? Sometimes, 
if the pictures are closely examined, small 
details, like the symmetry of the eyes, can look 
oﬀ  . Backgrounds, particularly if more than one 
person is in the picture, can look oﬀ  . However, 
these AIs are getting better every day, so the fakes 
are becoming harder for humans to detect.

How to Defend Against Deep Fakes
How does one defend against Deep Fakes? The ﬁ  rst step is education. The more people know about Deep 
Fakes, the more likely its is that societies can defend against them. These days, just because a picture or 
video is posted, does not mean it is real. Supporting evidence is needed, now that humans know that AIs 
can generate very realistic looking pictures and videos. Information sites such as the “This Person Does 
Not Exist” help educate the general public about Deep Fakes.
The next step is to develop techniques to detect Deep Fakes. There are several such techniques that 
researchers have already developed. They include
- Training Neural Networks to tell the diﬀ  erence between Real and Fake images and videos
- Using image processing software to detect the quality of an image and using that to distinguish real and 
fake items. Real pictures and videos are naturally consistent in the symmetry of the human face, shadows 
and lighting, etc. Fake images and videos have to work hard to get these right. By looking for these details, 
one can sometimes tell the fakes apart.
Companies are also establishing challenges to educate the public and encourage everyone to develop 
solutions. A great example is the Kaggle DeepFake Detection Challenge of 2019, which oﬀ  ered $1 Million 
for the best DeepFake Detection solution. 
Case study: Detecting Deep FakesCase study: Detecting Deep Fakes
A high school student built a novel website to detect Face Swaps, a type of DeepFake where the face 
of one person in a video is swapped with the face of a second person, making it seem as if the second 
person did whatever the ﬁ  rst person did in the video.
This student built his AI by processing each image of the video with a Python library called 
BRISQUE. BRISQUE, which stands for Blind/Reference less Image Spatial Quality Evaluator, is a 
set of techniques to assess image quality. By using a public dataset of real videos and face-swapped 
videos, he trained an AI to detect the image quality diﬀ  erences between real and fake videos. Users 
of his website can upload videos and the AI will use BRISQUE to evaluate the video image quality 
and decide whether it is fake. This app was a winner of the US Congressional App Challenge in 2021.

AI Ethics 130As companies and governments build ever larger AI models, another ethics issue that arises is that of 
resource consumption. Some of the largest AI models in the world consume tremendous amounts of 
computing power every time that they train. The case study below is taken from a research paper that 
describes the computing power consumed by the largest language models in the world, in comparison 
to other human tasks such as a plane fl  ight or driving a car. As the world battles climate change 
and tries to manage energy consumption, we also need to understand how much energy is being 
consumed by the AIs that we create.
Because of this issue, there are eﬀ  orts underway to develop AI models that are more energy eﬃ   cient. 
While many AI algorithms focus on creating models that have the highest possible predictive 
performance (such as accuracy), researchers are now developing AI algorithms that generate almost 
as much accuracy but do so with much less computing power. An example is DistilBERT from 
Hugging Face, which is 40% smaller than its full energy counterpart, yet up to 97% as eﬀ  ective on 
certain prediction tasks. These types of models can also be useful for other reasons. For example, 
AIs that are energy eﬃ   cient can be used in mobile phones, sensors, or other locations where large 
amounts of compute are not available.
AI and the Environment
Case study: Carbon Emissions of Large Language AIsCase study: Carbon Emissions of Large Language AIs
How much CO2 does a large AI generate? As we know, AIs need to be trained, and many AIs do not 
train just once. They need to be trained multiple times with tuning to get the best performance. Even 
after the best performance is achieved, the AI may still need to be retrained if new data is available. 
DATA TAKEN FROM REFERENCE SOURCE - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02243.pdf As the table shows, training a 
large AI can generate as much as 
ﬁ  ve times as much CO2 as one 
car consumes in its lifetime, and 
twenty times as much CO2 as 
an average American generates 
in a lifetime. As the world tries 
to cut down carbon emissions, 
AIs are clearly a place to focus.

AI and Data Access
Another area of concern among AI Ethicists is data access. As discovered in previous chapters, AI 
thrives on data. As companies and governments race to get an edge in AI, those with the most data 
have an advantage. As AI usage grows, what can societies do to ensure that some countries are not 
left behind due to a lack of data? Or should the world allow competition to occur naturally and let 
those who win,win?
Like most of the AI Ethics issues explored in this chapter, opinions vary and there is no established 
right answer. Eﬀ  orts are being made by large corporations to provide open access to datasets for 
critical problems - such as DeepFakes. Public datasets encourage wide innovation on new AI 
technologies from anywhere in the world. Data marketplaces, as covered earlier in this chapter, are 
another eﬀ  ort to give individuals more direct control over who proﬁ  ts from their personal information 
and create ways for data to be more widely accessible. Simulations and synthetic data are another 
way to create more data, hopefully in ways that enable everyone to beneﬁ  t. However, even with such 
eﬀ  orts, lack of data still remains a barrier to entry for many. For example, startup companies looking 
to innovate and compete with mainstream players and smaller nations looking to compete with more  
industrialized counterparts all struggle with the lack of data. 
As AI use explodes, one would expect to see more laws governing data access, for both privacy and 
competitive reasons.
AI Ethics - a global responsibility
Ensuring good AI Ethics is everyone’s responsibility. So what can we all do?
- Learn about AI Ethics (that is what this chapter is for!). 
- Learn how to build safe and responsible AIs. See the exercises at the end of this chapter to develop 
capabilities to build ethical AIs
- Share knowledge with others! AI is a great opportunity, but whether it turns out to be a beneﬁ  t or a 
problem for humanity will depend on all of us and how we manage, guide and shape AI.

Core Concepts
AI Ethics is a critical aspect of AI that individuals everywhere, particularly middle school and 
high school students, should learn. By the end of this chapter, students should be able to:
• Appreciate that there are many ways that AI intersects with human life and with businesses
• Understand and describe the need for Ethical practices in AI
• Understand and describe the technical aspects of AI that cause challenges
Grade Level Alignment
This chapter is appropriate for any middle school or high school grade level.


141 AI Ethics AI EthicsTips
Depending on the focus of your classroom, you may decide to teach the AI Ethics chapter right 
after Chapter 1 (What is AI). This combination is appropriate for any class where an in-depth 
exploration of AI is not planned.
Additional discussions that can help students explore the topic
• Explore the ethical aspects of other technologies - like Nuclear Power. Are there similarities? 
For example - Nuclear technology has created both power plants that power entire cities, 
and bombs that can kill millions. Was that a technology decision or a human one. How is the 
human race trying to manage this technology? Will we need similar actions for AI?
• When an AI makes a mistake, who is responsible? What if a self-driving car kills someone? 
Who is responsible?
• AIs learn bias from data and from humans. All humans are biased in some form. How is a 
biased AI more damaging? Is it because we dont understand the bias and do not know how 
to evaluate it?

Classification ClassificationCHAPTER 
5Classification
Artificial Intelligence services can perform several different types of tasks. 
Classification is the name given to AIs that predict a class (a category). In this 
chapter, several examples are used to understand the classification type of AI.


Classifi  cation 144
 Classifi  cation
 144
Classifi  cation is a type of AI where the 
AI predicts a category. A category can 
be Good vs Bad, Hot vs Cold etc. It does 
not matter what the input to the AI (the 
question) was. The input data can be 
numbers, categories, text, images, any 
combination of these, or anything else. 
It is only the format of the answer - the 
prediction - that determines whether the 
AI problem is Classifi  cation.What is Classiﬁ  cation?
144Classifi  cation can predict more than 2 categories. When there are only two categories, 
it is called Binary Classiﬁ  cation . When there are more than two, it is called Multi-Class 
Classiﬁ  cation . 
Classifi  cation is a type of supervised learning since the number of categories and the names of 
each category have to be known by the AI before it can learn the pattern and learn how to map 
questions to one of the category values as an answer. Figure 5.2 shows an example classifi  cation 
dataset. In this dataset, the AI will learn how to classify a person as an Adult  or a Child based on 
three pieces of information: the number of countries this person has visited, the number of years 
they have spent in school, and their height. Classiﬁ  ca�  on

When there are only two classes (categories) to predict, it is 
called Binary Classifi  cationConcept

Figure 5.1


145 Classifi  cation Classifi  cation
Classifi  cation can be done with virtually any 
type of data. The only factor that determines 
whether an AI is of type classifi  cation is the 
prediction label, which must be category. 
If this is true, no matter what the input 
(features), it is a classifi  cation problem. 
Figure 5.3 shows an example of classifi  cation with numerical and categorical data. In this case, a 
bank is trying to determine whether a customer is likely to stay with the bank or leave and close 
the account. As you can see from the table, there are many features, some numerical and some 
categorical. The numerical features include the customer’s age, bank balance, and income. The 
categorical features include whether they have a credit card (Yes or No), whether they are married 
(Yes or No), and whether they have kids (Yes or No). The label is Yes (they are likely to leave), 
or No (they are not). The categorical label determines the type of AI.Classiﬁ  ca�  on with Numerical and Categorical Data
Classiﬁ  ca�  on with Text Data
Figure 5.4 shows an example of 
classifi  cation with text data. In 
this case the feature is an English 
text (which can be anything 
from a single character to many 
sentences), and the prediction is 
Happy or Sad.

Figure 5.4 Example classifi  cation dataset


Classifi  cation 146Figure 5.5 shows an example of classifi  cation 
with images data. In this case, the feature 
is the image itself, and the prediction is the 
category Cat or Dog.
Note that many data types can be combined 
as well. For example, it is possible (and 
common) to have structured data where some 
columns are categories, some are numbers, 
and some are text.Classiﬁ  ca�  on with Images
As noted in Chapter 2, supervised learning 
algorithms are measured by splitting the 
data into a training set and a validation 
set, and using the training set to train the 
AI and the validation set to test the AI. 
Since classifi  cation is a supervised learning 
problem, this is the approach. This section 
describes exactly how the validation set is 
used to test a classifi  cation AI and some of 
the metrics used to measure classifi  cation 
performance.
Spam fi  ltering in GmailSpam fi  ltering in Gmail
Spam in emails had become a major issue and led to the emergence of algorithms that would 
automatically classify emails into spam and prevent them from crowding your inbox. Google 
used sophisticated AI algorithms (neural networks) to identify emails as spam. The results show 
that Gmail is able to catch 99.9 percent of the spam emails successfully . Achieving high accuracy 
here is important to ensure the user’s inbox is not ﬂ  ooded with junk emails. At the same time, the 
user should not miss an important email because of mis-classifi  cation
How is Classiﬁ  cation Measured?

Figure 5.6
Context


147 Classifi  cation Classifi  cation
 Accuracy
The most basic and common measure of 
a classifi  cation AI is accuracy. Figure 5.7 
shows how accuracy works. Each row of the 
validation dataset is submitted to the AI and 
its response is compared to the correct answer 
already available in the Validation set. The 
accuracy is the number of correct answers 
divided by the total number of questions. The 
highest possible accuracy is 100% (if the AI 
got all predictions right) and the lowest is 0% 
(if the AI got all predictions wrong). 
What constitutes good accuracy? It is extremely situation dependent. For example, if the AI is used to 
predict whether an aircraft will crash, or whether a person has cancer, even a 95% accuracy is likely 
not good enough - since it implies a 5% chance of a life threatening outcome. On the other hand, if the 
AI is used to recommend books - even at 85% accuracy is great - because the downside of an incorrect 
prediction is the minor inconvenience of reading part of a book you may not like. The accuracy metric 
will provide a numerical answer, how it is interpreted is a matter of human judgment.
Flaws in Accuracy
Accuracy is not a perfect metric. Consider the two scenarios in Figure 5.8 where the AI is predicting 
between Adult  and Child. In each case the correct answer is in column True Label and the AI’s prediction 
is in column Predicted Value. The AI on the left has an accuracy of 60% and the AI on the right has an 
accuracy of 80%. If only the accuracy metric is inspected, the AI on the right would be deemed superior. 
However, a closer examination of the tables shows that the AI on the right never predicts Adult . So why 
did it get a higher accuracy?Figure 5.7 Example of accuracy calculation
Figures 5.8 Two tables showing predictions made by two AIs 


Classifi  cation 148The AI on the right got a higher accuracy because the validation dataset had only two examples of 
Adult (20%). Since the validation dataset was selected randomly from the dataset, this suggests that 
the original dataset was heavily skewed and likely had over few examples of Adult . When such skew 
occurs, the accuracy metric can be misleading.
Skew is unfortunately a common issue in real world datasets since all the categories that the AI is 
expected to predict are unlikely to occur with equal frequency.
Data Skew in Real LifeData Skew in Real Life
Artifi  cial Intelligence algorithms are being used in medical diagnosis to assist doctors in making 
diagnosis. For example, an AI can be trained to recognize patterns of cancer cells from pathology 
images of biopsies. One thing to note here is that datasets that are used for training these AIs will 
typically have more examples of healthy patients than the ones with cancer since most biopsies 
come back with a negative result. It is the responsibility of the data scientist to take into account 
the skew in data and inspect the confusion matrix along with accuracy to ensure the AI does not 
miss patients with cancer. If an AI mis-predicts someone having cancer as healthy, it directly 
impacts the life of an individual and hence care is taken that only the AIs with perfect diagnostic 
score for the cancerous category are used in real life. Confusion Matrix
While accuracy is a useful metric, it is 
often insuﬃ   cient to fully understand 
the AI’s behavior. To provide more 
insight, there is a second metric, 
Confusion Matrix. Figure 5.9 shows 
the confusion matrices for the fi  rst 
example in Figure 5.8
The confusion matrix contains one row and one column for every category being predicted. As 
such, a binary classifi  cation problem would have a 2x2 confusion matrix (2 rows and 2 columns). 
A classifi  cation problem with 5 categories would have 5 rows and 5 columns, and so on. Each row 
represents all the examples in the validation dataset for which the answer is that category. Each column 
represents what the AI predicted. For example, in Figure X, you can see that the validation dataset 
contained 5 examples of Child and 5 examples of Adult . In each case, the AI got 3 correct (3 child 
correct and 3 adult correct) and 2 wrong.
Figures 5.9 Confusion matrix example
Context


149 Classifi  cation Classifi  cationKey Insight
The diagonal of the Confusion 
Matrix represents all the correct 
answers. Everything else 
represents incorrect predictions. 
The Confusion Matrix helps 
understand what type of questions 
the AI predicted incorrectly.The accuracy can be calculated from the 
confusion matrix. Just add up all of the numbers 
on the diagonal and divide by the sum of all 
the numbers in the entire matrix. As we noted 
before, the accuracy was 60%.
So, how does the confusion matrix provide 
more insight into the behavior of the AI? 
Figure 5.10 shows the confusion matrix of the 
second AI. In studying this, several concerns 
are apparent. First, the numbers on each row 
are not even and the validation set contained 
far more Adult  examples than Child examples. 
Second, the Child column is entirely zeros, 
indicating that this AI has not demonstrated 
an ability to predict Child no matter what the 
correct answer was. Even though the accuracy 
is 80%, we can see that this is an inferior AI.
False Posi�  ves and Nega�  ves, True Posi�  ves and Nega�  ves
When the classifi  cation is a binary classifi  cation (two categories), there are several other terms that are 
used that you should know. These are very common when AI is used to diagnose diseases, for example.
One of the two categories is called the Positive, and the other the Negative. For example, if your AI is 
diagnosing cancer, Positive will be that you have cancer. True Positive means that the correct answer 
is Positive and the AI predicted Positive. False Positive means that the correct answer is Negative and 
the AI predicted Positive.
While True Positives and True Negatives are always good, False Positives and False Negatives are not 
equally bad. In many cases where AI is used to diagnose diseases, a False Negative can be far more 
harmful than a False Positive. A False Negative by an AI can send a sick patient home where they may 
get sicker. A False Positive, while it may cause stress, is less harmful since it will likely be followed by 
more medical tests which will prove that the AI made a mistake. 
Figures 5.10


Classifi  cation 150Now that we know how to measure an AI, what are the characteristics that we should be looking for 
to determine whether our AI is good at its job?
The next thing to ensure is that your AI is 
able to predict all of the categories correctly 
(or at least satisfactorily). Confusion matrix 
can be inspected to confi  rm this. It should be 
confi  rmed that the AI is not getting a high 
accuracy score just because the questions 
are skewed and not testing all categories. 
How good is good enough again depends on 
human judgment. It may be more important 
to get some categories right than others. It is 
decided based on the problem (think about 
the example earlier about positive vs negative 
detection in cancer).The fi  rst is high accuracy. Note that if your AI is predicting between two categories and its accuracy 
is 50%, that is the same as a random guess! If its accuracy is less than 50%, then taking the opposite 
answer from what your AI predicts is actually the better choice! As long as the accuracy is greater 
than 50%, at least the AI has learned something. From then on - higher accuracy is better. You can 
use the same logic for more than 2 categories. For example, if the AI is predicting between three 
categories, 33% (or 100/3) is as good as a random guess. 
If an AI is predicting 4 
categories (a) Happy (b) 
Neutral (c) Annoyed and (d) 
Angry, with an accuracy of 
23.5%, is that better than 
random prediction?
How about if the accuracy was 
50%Once the AI has learned something and is not randomly 
guessing, one has to apply human judgment to decide 
whether the accuracy is good enough. For example, a 60% 
accuracy is likely not good no matter what the problem is. 
85% accuracy on the other hand, is good for many problems 
like recommending books, where the consequences of a 
wrong answer are not too bad. In medical usages, or any 
other situation where a wrong answer can hurt people, 85% 
will not be acceptable, and values of 95% or greater will 
likely be required.

Common Classiﬁ  cation Algorithms
AI in AgricultureAI in Agriculture
Artifi  cial Intelligence algorithms are being used in agriculture to inspect plants for diseases. 
For example, an AI can look at the picture of a tomato plant and classify it as (a) Healthy 
(b) Early Blight (c) Late Blight (d) Septoria or (d) Curl Virus. Such an AI helps farmers use 
automation for recognition of plant diseases. This helps them take steps early and prevent 
further damage to the crop. You can read more about this project here: https://www.corp.aiclub.
world/post/the-success-of-tomato-geniusThere are many AI algorithms that can perform classifi  cation. Some are listed below
- Decision Trees (covered later in this book)
- K Nearest Neighbors (covered later in this book)
- Neural Networks (covered later in this book)
- Logistic Regression (covered in the Advanced AI book)
- Support Vector Machines (covered in the Advanced AI book)
What do these algorithms have in common? They are all able to fi  nd patterns in the input 
data that separate diff  erent categories. Metrics of accuracy and confusion matrix are used to 
decide if each algorithm is doing a good job predicting the label categories in the data. These 
metrics can be used to compare diff  erent algorithms and select the best one.
What makes these algorithms diff  erent? They are all diff  erent approaches, and each has its 
advantages and disadvantages. For example - Decision Trees and K Nearest Neighbor are 
Explainable, which means that they can provide humans with a description of how they 
arrived at their prediction decision. This can be very useful when your AI is in a fi  eld where 
the company using it can get sued, or where we want to make sure that the AI is applied 
fairly and does not make biased decisions. Neural Networks on the other hand are great for 
complex data (like deciding whether a picture contains a cat or a dog), but are much harder to 
explain.

Regression 166


167 Regression RegressionCHAPTER 
6Regression
Artiﬁ  cial Intelligence services that predict numbers, rather than from a ﬁ  xed 
set of categories, are called regression. In this chapter, several examples are 
presented to understand this type of AI.


Regression 168
 Regression
 168
168Regression is a type of AI where the goal is to predict a numerical value. The number can 
be a decimal value or an integer value (whole number). The number can also be positive or 
negative. For example, one might want the AI to predict the price of a house. The price could 
be any value such as $200,000 or $212,456.56 etc. Just like classiﬁ  cation problems, it does not 
matter what the input to the AI (the question) was. The input data can be numbers, categories, 
text, images, any combination of these, or anything else. It is only the format of the answer, 
the prediction, that determines whether the AI problem is regression.
Regression is a type of supervised 
learning since the label value 
(which is numerical here) has to 
be known by the AI before it can 
learn the pattern. Once it learns 
the pattern, it can map questions 
to a numerical value as an answer. 
Figure 6.2 shows an example 
regression dataset. In this dataset, 
the AI will learn how to predict 
the price of a house based on two 
pieces of information, square 
footage  and the age of the house.
What is Regression?
Figure 6.1 Analyzing data for prediction
Figure 6.2: An example regression dataset


169 Regression Regression
 168The only factor that determines whether an AI is of type classiﬁ  cation or regression is the prediction 
label. If the label is a number, no matter what the input (features), it is a regression problem. 
Figure 6.3  shows an example of regression 
with numerical and categorical data. In 
this case, a insurance company is trying 
to determine the medical charges that a 
customer might incur. There are two features, 
Age and Gender, where Age is numerical 
and Gender is categorical. The label column 
Charges is a numerical value and hence this 
is a regression problem.Regression with Numerical and Categorical Data
Regression with Text Data
Figure 6.4 shows an example of regression 
with text data. In this case the feature is 
English text (which can be anything from 
a single character to many sentences) 
describing the movie and the prediction is 
a number that rates the movie on a scale 
between 1 and 5.
Regression in Real LifeRegression in Real Life
Regression is very widely used for many real-world applications. An example is forecasting, 
where one can predict the future demand of a product based on historical values. Another 
example is the optimization of business processes such as to predict customer satisfaction in a 
call center based on wait times. Such data driven approaches in businesses help with making 
operations eﬃ   cient. Another example: setting up automated alerts, where a regression AI can 
predict an impending breakdown and alert in advance. For example, if a factory is operating a

How is Regression Measured?
Supervised learning algorithms are 
measured by splitting the data into a 
training set and a validation set, and 
using the training set to train the AI 
and the validation set to test the AI. 
Regression, like classiﬁ  cation, is a 
supervised learning method and hence 
the same process is followed to measure 
the performance of a regression AI. In 
this section, the popular metrics used to 
measure it are described.
House Prices PredictionHouse Prices Prediction
Websites like Redﬁ  n, Zillow, Realtor etc provide 
estimates of the prices of houses. The algorithm 
that predicts the house price values is a Regression 
algorithm. It takes into account features like location, 
square footage of the house, age of the house etc. to 
create these estimates. This provides users of these 
websites an estimate to compare with the price at 
which a house is listed in the market. Mean Absolute Error
In Chapter 5, accuracy was described as a metric that measures the overall performance of a classiﬁ  cation 
AI. In case of classiﬁ  cation, it is very clear if the AI is right or wrong about an answer. However, 
applying the same to a regression problem is tricky. For example, if an AI predicts the temperature for 
tomorrow and it is quite close, but not exact, how can one measure how good the AI is? One way to 
do this is to simply measure the error. Error here is the diﬀ  erence between the predicted value and the 
correct value.

Figure 6.6 House price prediction
Context


171 Regression RegressionMean Absolute Error (MAE)  is the average of all the 
absolute errors. Concept
Mean 
Absolute 
Error
For example, if the temperature that the AI predicted is 70 and the correct value was 71, then the error 
is 71-70 = 1. Consider another example where the AI predicts 11 and the correct value is 10. Then, 
11 minus 10 is 1. This implies that the AI is oﬀ   from the true value by 1. If the AI predicts the exact 
value, the error is 0. 
In another example where the correct value is 10 and the AI predicted 9, the error is -1.  The AI is 
oﬀ   by 1 in this case too. It doesn’t matter whether it is a positive error or a negative error. Therefore, 
something called an absolute value is calculated. Taking the absolute value of a number means that 
weather its a positive number or a negative number does not matter. In this case, for example, the 
absolute value of -1 is 1. Another example would be the absolute value of -10, which would be 10. 
The absolute value of 10 is also 10. 
The absolute error of an AI indicates that the prediction of the AI was oﬀ   by the value speciﬁ  ed by 
the error. 
Going back to the concept of accuracy, it is calculate by asking the AI multiple questions and then 
checking how many it got correctly. Similarly, when a regression AI predicts for multiple questions 
and it provides a set of answers, which results in a set of error values. In case of accuracy, the number 
of correct answers is counted. In case of a set of errors, they need to be combined. 
For example, if the AI got errors, 1.2, 5.1, 2, 3 etc.., the average of all the errors can be calculated to 
get a single metric describing the average error of the AI. Absolute value is calculated followed by 
calculating the average of these errors. This indicates on an average how oﬀ   the AI is from the right 
prediction. This popular metric is called Mean Absolute Error (MAE).True Value Predicted Value Error Absolute Error
71 70 1 1
10 11 -1 1
10 9 1 1
11 14 -3 3
Figure 6.7 Measuring the error on each sample


Regression 172In case of accuracy, the higher the number, the better the AI is. 100% accuracy is the best and zero 
accuracy is the worst. In contrast,  a low value of error indicates a better performing AI. An average 
error of 0 implies that the AI makes perfect predictions all the time. Unlike accuracy, which has the 
worst value of zero, there is no limit to how bad an error can be. MAE can be any value. The higher the 
MAE, the worse the AI.
Regression in Real Life: Dynamic PricingRegression in Real Life: Dynamic Pricing
Dynamic pricing is essentially diﬀ  erent prices for diﬀ  erent situations. This could be diﬀ  erent 
prices for diﬀ  erent customers, diﬀ  erent prices at diﬀ  erent times for the same customer etc. 
Broadly adjusting prices to meet various kinds of situations, like increases in demand or changing 
price in response to what competitors are doing, is called dynamic pricing. With regression AIs, 
companies can predict prices for anything.
Dynamic pricing is not unique to AI, it has been going on for a very long time. For example, 
it has been pretty standard for a long time that air tickets cost more when not booked well in 
advance. Last minute tickets for pretty much anything always seem to cost more. Dynamic 
pricing did not show up because of AI. However, AI made dynamic pricing far more adaptive, 
and far more responsive to lots of diﬀ  erent kinds of situations. After the advent of AI in dynamic 
pricing, prices can change every minute. For example, they can change based on things that 
recently occurred in the news. 
An item’s price might change based on other things the customer recently bought. It could change 
based on how many other people are looking to buy the same item. One such example  is sur ge 
pricing in Uber, or Lyft. AI is changing the way that products of all kinds, whether they be slots 
on a freeway or actual physical products, are priced and sold. It also means that, for companies, 
the more they know about their customers and the more that they know about what’ s going on in 
the world that might impact their product, the more they can ﬁ  nd the right price for everything at 
any point in time. Root Mean Square Error
Another popular metric used to measure the 
performance of a regression AI is RMSE, short 
for Root Mean Square Error. To calculate this 
metric, a square of the error values is calculated 
before taking the average value. A square root of 
the average value is taken to get the Root of the 
Mean of the Squared Error values.Key Insight
In case of accuracy, the higher the 
number, the better it is. 100% accuracy 
is the best you can get and zero accuracy 
is really bad. In contrast, for regression 
metrics MAE and RMSE, a low value of 
error indicates a high performance AI. 
Zero error is the best possible error. 
Context


173 Regression Regression
We have so far seen that 0 is the best MAE or RMSE value that an AI can achieve for a regression 
problem. However, in the real world, this is seldom the case. Most AIs will have a RMSE or MAE value 
that is not zero. Given a RMSE value, how can one decide if it’s a good enough AI? For example, if the 
MAE value is equal to 10, would that be considered a good AI? This depends on what is being predicted.
If the price of a house is being predicted and the AI is oﬀ   by $10, that is an acceptable MAE value. 
However, if the AI is predicting the temperature and is oﬀ   by 10 degrees Centigrade, its not an 
acceptable error. The scale of the label being predicted by the AI determines whether a given MAE 
value is acceptable or not.
A second thing to consider is whether the AI is better than random guessing. In case of classiﬁ  cation 
and accuracy, a 50% accuracy is the baseline when the AI predicts 2 categories. If the AI predicts 3 
categories, 33.33% is the baseline. Similarly, regression also has a baseline. Figure 6.8 is used to learn 
how to calculate this baseline.
Characteristics of Good Regression AI
There are 4 samples in this dataset and Charges
is the prediction variable. To make the best 
guess of a prediction value without any AI, the 
best chance at it would be to take an average of 
the column Charges. Average of the column is 
(423.89 + 334.15 + 231.1 + 451.5)/4 = 360.16. 
This would be the value that is predicted 
irrespective of the values in Age and Gender. 
This is the baseline that the AI has to be better 
than. If the AI performs worse than this baseline, 
it’s not useful to have an AI at all. The baseline 
error in this case (MAE) is 77.54.
Figure 6.9 shows an example scenario, where the 
absolute error for the four samples is calculated. 
Mean Absolute Error is the average of the 
absolute errors of the samples, which is (63.73 
+ 26.01 +  129.06 + 91.34)/4 = 77.535. In this 
case, the AI is not good. A good AI is expected 
to have an MAE much better than the baseline 
MAE of 77.535.Figure 6.8: Sample data
Figure 6.9: Prediction and Error


Regression 174
Common Regression Algorithms
What do these algorithms have in common? They are all able to ﬁ  nd patterns in the input data 
and map it to a numerical value which is the prediction. You can also use the metrics of MAE and 
RMSE to decide if each algorithm is doing a good job predicting the label in your data. You can 
compare the diﬀ  erent algorithms using these metrics and select the best one.
Demand ForecastingDemand Forecasting
The process of predicting the demand of 
products are called demand forecasting. 
Such forecasting is very important for 
manufacturers and retailers to manage 
production processes. 
Think about shopping at a store. As a 
customer, you expect products to be always 
available. Customers are not happy when 
something they want to purchase is out of 
stock. Being able forecast demand, even 
across seasonal variations, is very important 
for businesses to keep their customers happy. There are many AI algorithms that can perform regression. Some are listed below
- Linear Regression (covered later in this book)
- K Nearest Neighbors (covered later in this book)
- Neural Networks (covered later in this book)
- Decision Trees (Covered in V olume 2)
The concept of demand forecasting has been there for a long time before AI came into picture. 
With the advent of AI, the process of forecasting has become more accurate and ﬁ  ne grained. 
AI also makes it easier to use historical data to forecast demand.
These AI algorithms are not perfect though. Their predictions are based on trends they see 
in historical data. For example, they cannot adapt to sudden changes in supply or demand 
that occur due to environmental conditions. For example, sudden heat waves might increase 
the demand for air conditioning units. The COVID pandemic caused a disruption that the 
algorithms had no hope of coping with because it was not an event they have been trained for . 
However, in general, these algorithms have proved to be quite eﬀ  ective for helping businesses 
manage their supply chains.Figure 6.10 Forecasting demand

Regression 182Teachers Corner
Core Concepts
Chapter 6 introduced Regression, another very important and powerful type of AI that is used 
everyday in industries from marketing to sales to ﬁ  nance. After studying this chapter, students 
should be able to:
• Understand the diﬀ  erence between Classiﬁ  cation and regression
• Appreciate that, like Classiﬁ  cation, Regression can also be used with any type of feature 
data (text, numbers, categories, images, etc.) It is only the type of label (numerical) that 
makes an AI problem a Regression problem.
• Understand why Classiﬁ  cation metrics like Accuracy and Confusion Matrix cannot be used 
to measure Regression.
• Appreciate the use or Error based metrics for regression. Understand the diﬀ  erence 
between Error based metrics and classiﬁ  cation metrics.
• Understand some examples of Regression use around the world.
Grade Level Alignment
The concepts in this chapter are accessible to students in any Middle School or High School 
grade, with one exception. RMSE is challenging for 6th and 7th grade students and is 
recommended for students in 8th grade and above.
The plugged exercises at the end of the chapter can also be used by students in any middle 
school or high school grade. The python coding exercises however, are more suitable for 
students in grades 8 and above, or any student that has familiarity with the following python 
elements
• Input/Output
• Loops and Conditionals
• Lists
• Modules
• SciKit Learn Module
The Curriculum section below contains introductions to all of these Python elements.  
Tips
The concepts in this chapter can be understood without doing any of the plugged exercises or 
code exercises, but doing the plugged exercise is strongly recommended. 


183 Regression RegressionTeachers Corner Teachers Corner
The students do not need any coding knowledge to do the plugged exercise. Encourage 
students to explore the regression AI they build to get a better understanding of how 
regression works. Comparing the regression AI they build here to the classiﬁ  cation AI they 
built as part of Plugged Exercises in Chapter 5 will also generate more insight.
Now that students have an understanding of both classiﬁ  cation and regression, encourage 
them to think about whether a regression problem can be made into a classiﬁ  cation problem. 
For example - if the AI is predicting rainfall in inches, that is a regression problem. However, 
if the label values are made into buckets (for example, any rainfall between 0 and 2 inches is 
“Low”, any between 2 and 5 inches is “Medium”, etc.), the same problem can be converted 
into classiﬁ  cation.
The coding exercises are optional but encouraged for high school students in computer 
science classes. Doing these exercises will give the students greater appreciation of how AIs 
are built in code.

K Nearest Neighbors 184


185 K Nearest Neighbors K Nearest NeighborsCHAPTER 
7K Nearest Neighbors 
In this chapter, a very popular algorithm called KNN is explored. KNN is short for K 
nearest neighbors. This algorithm is quite popular and very easy to understand.


K Nearest Neighbors 186

186Datasets for K Nearest Neighbor
Figure 7.1 Example dataset with two
features and a label KNN algorithm can be used for both classifi  cation and regression types of problems. KNN 
is used in supervised learning which means the training data for the algorithm contains both 
features and labels. KNN can predict both, numbers and categories. 
Features of the dataset can be anything like numbers, categories, text etc. In the real world 
examples, datasets have hundreds of features. Two examples, one for classifi  cation and one for 
regression are presented in this chapter to understand how K nearest neighbors works.
How does a KNN predict
In this data set there are only two features,  
Years in school and height ,  and the label 
is whether someone is an adult or a child . 
Whenever a row in the table is adult, it is 
represented by a red dot and whenever a row 
is child, it is represented by a green dot. The 
categories in the label column are color coded 
so that a plot of the data provides a visual sense 
of how the data looks.
Figure 7.2 Plot of the dataset with features Years in 
school on the x-axis and label height  on the y-axis Plot of this dataset is shown in Figure 7.2. 
Column Years in school is on the x-axis, and 
height  is on the y-axis.
All the red points in the plot are adults, and 
all the green points are children. A visual 
inspection of the pattern of points in the plot 
shows that if the height is a small number, then 
most likely it’s a child. If Years in school is 
a large number, then its most likely an adult, 
even if the height is a small number. This is 
the kind of visual insight that plotting the data 
can provide. KNN can predict both, numbers and categories. 
The fi  rst example shown in Figure 7.1 is one 
where KNN predicts categories.  


187 K Nearest Neighbors K Nearest Neighbors
 186Datasets for K Nearest Neighbor
The way a K nearest neighbors algorithm 
make predictions is easy to understand 
using the plot. KNN looks at the training 
data provided and memorizes it. It 
uses this information to make future 
predictions. For example, if the KNN 
algorithm has to make a prediction on 
whether someone is an adult or a child, 
like the new point shown in Figure 7.3, 
it looks at this point in the context of the 
training data around it.
The new point shown in the fi  gure has Years in 
school around six and height around fi  ve. The 
reason this point is not colored is that the new 
point is an adult or a child. A KNN algorithm 
that has memorized the training data will look 
for K nearest neighbors to the point. If K is 
assume to be one, KNN will look at one nearest 
point as shown in Figure 7.4. 
Since a red point, which represents an adult is 
the closest neighbor, KNN will predict the new 
point to be an adult. This is how KNN makes 
predictions. However, the value of K here can be 
chosen by the user. 
If K is three instead of one, KNN algorithm 
looks at three neighbors. Figure 7.5 shows the 
three closest neighbors. In this case, note that 
two neighbors are green and one neighbor is 
red. The algorithm picks green, which is a child 
as its prediction. This shows that in a K nearest 
neighbors algorithm, depending on the value of K 
chosen by the user, the algorithm may predict an 
adult or a child. Figure 7.3 A new point shown by the uncolored 
circle in the plot too illustrate how KNN makes 
predictions
Figure 7.4 Predictions using a KNN model for a 
value of K=1. 
Figure 7.5 Predictions using a KNN model for a 
value of K=3. 


K Nearest Neighbors 188
Figure 7.6 shows an example of a regression data 
set. A data set is regression, when the prediction 
variable is a continuous number. For example, in 
this case, price of a house is a continuous number 
and not a category. Price of a house could be any 
number and hence it’s a regression problem. 
Plotting a regression dataset is a little bit tricky. 
It’s diff  erent from classifi  cation, where each 
category can be color coded. In regression, there 
are no categories. Using diff  erent colors for each 
unique value will be too many colors and can be 
visually confusing. A good way to plot for a case 
like this is to assign every point a number. There 
is no color coding, but every point has a unique 
number assigned in the column index  in Figure 
7.6.  This table is much bigger than the previous 
one because there is a new column called an index, 
which is here simply to identify the sample. It’s 
not a feature, the features are square footage of the 
house represented by the column sq_ft and the age
of the house. The AI should predict the label which 
is the price of the house. 
There are 10 points, and every point represents a 
single sample plotted in Figure 7.7. KNN follows 
exactly the same principle that it followed in 
classifi  cation. If a new house comes in, which 
is around 600 square feet and 28 years old, how 
does a KNN algorithm predict this value?. If the 
value of K is three, it is going to look at who the 
nearest neighbors are. Here, it turns out that the 
samples with index seven, eight, and nine are the 
nearest neighbors. 
In this case, what should the price of this house 
be? Figure 7.6 Example regression dataset with 
two features sq_ft, age and a label price.
Figure 7.7 Plot of the dataset in Figure 7.6
Figure 7.8 A new point shown by the uncolored 
circle in the plot to illustrate how KNN makes
predictions


189 K Nearest Neighbors K Nearest NeighborsIn the real world, it turns out that there are several diff  erent ways to do this. A really simple way 
is to take the average. Average of the seventh house, the eighth house and the ninth house would 
be the price of the new house. These are the ways that an AI predicts in the case of KNN for 
classifi  cation, and regression. 
Hyper-parameters of KNN
K is a hyper-parameter of KNN. The reason it is called a hyper-parameter is because this value is 
set by the user and has an impact on how the algorithm behaves. An important question is how do 
you fi  nd the best K?. The process of fi  nding the best K is called hyper parameter tuning. It’s very 
hard to give a single value of K as an answer. Every dataset is unique and part of the puzzle is to 
fi  nd out by simply trying out diff  erent values. It’s something to experiment and fi  nd out. 
Whichever value gives the best performance is the best K for the dataset. The process of fi  guring 
out this value of K is called hyper parameter tuning. 
In summary, KNN is a very simple algorithm and is very easy to understand. It has a single hype-
parameter called K that can be tuned. There are many algorithms that are more sophisticated and 
have many hyper parameters to tune. In such a case, hyper-parameter tuning can be very complex. 
KNN has the advantage of being really simple, easy to understand, and easy to hyper parameter 
tune.
Pi�  alls of KNN
Exercise: Guess the House PriceExercise: Guess the House Price
House one is 1000 square feet and zero years old, 
house two is 800 square feet eight and zero years 
old. House three is 1000 square feet and 100 years 
old. The label value is the price of the house. House 
number two is $10,000 and house number three is 
$5,000. As a human, if you were to predict the price 
of house one and you have only two options to pick 
from, either $10,000 or $5,000, what would you pick?
Let’s look at what KNN would pick. If K is equal to one, what is the closest neighbor in terms of 
the features, which is square footage and age here. It turns out that the distance between house 
one and house two is 200. The distance between house one and house three is only 100. So, it 
would pick house 3, whose price is 5000$.Figure 7.9 A table with two features Square feet 
and age, one label Price and just 2 samples in 
training data.
Context


K Nearest Neighbors190Table in Figure 7.9 is an illustration of one of the pitfalls of KNN. A house that is 100 years old 
is actually pretty cheap compared to a house which is brand new. The age of a house is much 
more important than the square footage. 
However, KNN completely misses this. The reason it misses it is it does not know that square 
footage is more important or less important than age, it rates all features equally. However, 
square footage can be anywhere from like 800 to 3000, but age can only be between 0 to 200. 
People usually do not live in a 1000 year old house. Typically, houses are between 0 and 200. 
Square footage on the other hand, can be from 800 to 3000. Clearly , the scale is different. The 
numbers start differently. Square footage does not start at zero, but age starts at zero. So, the 
starting point of these features is also different. In addition, the range is also different. As a 
result, KNN can sometimes give really bad results because it does not know which feature is 
more important. This is a drawback of KNN to keep in mind. If an awesome data set that is 
supposed to do really well with the AI, is giving bad predictions, then think about whether the 
features in the dataset have different scales. 
There are a lot of things that researchers have done to make sure that one can indirectly tell 
KNN that one feature is more important than the other. For the specific example in Figure 7.9, 
one really easy way to do this is, multiply all values of age with 1000. Then the value of age 
is between zero and 200,000 instead of being between 0 and 200. Such multiplication with a 
constant number artificially increases the range of age. Alternatively, one can divide all the 
values of square feet by a constant number to make sure that they are more or less equal in 
range. This is one example of how the drawback of KNN can be overcome. 
Another important pitfall of KNN to keep in mind is that it can only predict a value that is in 
the range of training data. If for example, the KNN needs to predict the price of a house whose 
square footage is much larger than the maximum value present in training data, KNN can only 
refer to the closest examples in training data. It will not be able to scale up the price of the 
house proportionally.

Core Concepts
K Nearest Neighbors is a simple and powerful algorithm that can be used for both 
Classifi  cation and Regression. Like most AI algorithms, it is not universally useful but is 
appropriate for specifi  c situations. After studying this chapter, students should be able to:
• Understand how KNN works 
• Understand how KNN works a bit diff  erently for Classifi  cation and Regression
• Appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm
• Identify real-world applications that benefi  t from KNN
• Understand why K is a key hyper-parameter (tuning knob) for KNN. Appreciate why 
diff  erent values of K can result in diff  erent behavior by the same AI algorithm. 
Grade Level Alignment
KNN is accessible to students in any middle school or high school grade. Students in grades 
8 and above, who have had a course in Algebra, will be able to appreciate in more depth the 
concept of distance that KNN relies upon. 
The plugged exercises are accessible to any student in middle school or high school, who 
can use them to build an AI with KNN, tune it, and explore how it works. The python coding 
exercises however, are more suitable for students in grades 8 and above, or any student that 
has familiarity with the following python elements
• Input/Output
• Loops and Conditionals
• Lists
• Modules
• Pandas and Dataframes
• SciKit Learn Module
The Curriculum section below contains introductions to all of these Python elements.


K Nearest Neighbors 202Teachers Corner
Tips
Encourage students to build the AI in the plugged exercise and tune K themselves. This 
will help them appreciate that the value of K can change the algorithm’ s eff  ectiveness very 
quickly.
If this is done in a class, encourage all the students to tune K and compare what values gave 
them the best results. They will likely fi  nd that the best values of K may not be the same 
for all of them. This is because there are often many good values of K, sometimes quite far 
apart. This is normal behaviour for AI algorithms, and a good area for students to explore and 
appreciate.

Linear Regression 204


205 Linear Regression Linear RegressionCHAPTER 
8Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a very popular algorithm used for solving the regression type of 
AI problems. Linear here means that the relationship between features and label is 
expected to be linear. This chapter covers Linear Regression. how it works, and what 
types of problems it is suitable for.


Linear Regression 206
 Linear Regression

Figure 8.1 Example dataset with one 
feature and label Linear regression is a type of supervised learning, which means that the training data for the 
algorithm contains both features and labels. Linear regression does not predict categories, which 
means it cannot learn classiﬁ  cation types of problems. It is used only for regression, or in other 
words, problems where the prediction label is a number. Features on the other hand can be 
anything like numbers, categories, text etc. In real world uses of linear regression, datasets can 
have hundreds of features of any of these types or combinations. 
To begin, lets explore some examples to understand how linear regression works.
How does Linear Regression Work?
This is a very simpliﬁ  ed dataset for illustration 
purposes. The ﬁ  rst column is the feature and 
the second column is the label. The AI gets one 
feature to learn from and it is supposed to predict 
the label value. 
The plot shown in Figure 8.2 visualizes this data. 
The x axis is the feature, and the y axis is the 
label. The four green dots correspond to each 
row of Figure 8.1. For example, the ﬁ  rst dot 
corresponds to the ﬁ  rst row. The feature value is 
0.2, and the corresponding label is 2.8.
Figure 8.2 Plot of the dataset with the feature 
on the x-axis and the label on the y-axis By just looking at this visualization of the data, 
one can guess the general trend of the data. It 
follows the pattern of a line. There is a linear 
relationship between the feature on the x-axis 
and the label on the y-axis. In addition, a larger 
value of the feature seems to positively correlate 
with a larger value of the label value.  In other 
words, as the feature increases, so does the label.Datasets for Linear Regression
Linear regression is explored in this section using 
an example dataset as shown in Figure 8.1.  
206


207 Linear Regression Linear Regression
Datasets for Linear Regression
206The red line in Figure 8.3 captures the 
relationship between the feature and the 
label. If this is assumed to be the linear 
regression model, the next step would be 
to understand how such a model could be 
used to make predictions. For example, 
if a new feature has a value of 0.8, how 
would the linear regression model make a 
prediction?  Table in Figure 8.1 does not 
have this value as a part of training data.
In order to make predictions using a model 
represented by the red line, project a line from 
the value 0.8 on the x-axis to the red line. Then, 
project a line to the y-axis from the point of 
intersection at the red line. Figure 8.4 illustrates 
this using the blue lines. It shows that, for 
an incoming feature value of 0.8, the model 
would predict 5 as the label. Whether this is an 
accurate prediction or not depends on what the 
accurate value for it was. This would be how 
predictions are made when the AI model is 
ﬁ  tting a line. Linear regression is often called 
“line-ﬁ  tting” for this reason.
The linear regression model is a line that best ﬁ  ts the data. When there is a single feature, it can be 
visualized as a line but the same idea applies no matter how many features there are. For a single 
feature, mathematically, this line is represented by the equation (Equation 8.1):
Label = w0+ w1 x feature
w0  here is very popularly called the intercept. An intercept is not multiplied with anything. It’s a 
freestanding value. It can potentially take any numerical value.
The second parameter in the above equation is w1, which is multiplied with the feature. Since there 
is a single feature, there is only one parameter w1. This is the equation of the red line in Figure 8.3. 
Parameters of linear regression are also known as model coeﬃ   cients. Figure 8.3 A line representing trend of data in the
plot
Figure 8.4 Predictions using a linear regression
model for an example feature value of 0.8. 
Parameters of Linear Regression
Equation 8.1


Linear Regression 208Going back to the question we answered before, if the incoming feature is 0.8, how would the model 
predict the label value? Given that the model is a line shown in the equation, the label value will be 
predicted by substituting the value 0.8 into the equation. This is shown below (Equation 8.2).
label = w0 + w1 x 0.8
Depending on what the values of w0 and w1 are, the label value will be calculated. Therefore, the key 
during the training process is to determine good values for w0 and w1 based on the training data. It’s 
important to understand the impact of the value of w0 and w1 on the position and orientation of the line. 
Diﬀ  erent values of w0 and w1 will result in diﬀ  erent positions and orientations of the line. This is shown 
in Figure 8.5. Here the feature is “x” and the prediction is “y”.
Another example dataset is shown in Figure 8.6. 
The goal here is to predict the price of a house. 
Here as well, there is a single feature, which is 
square feet, and the label is the price. 
A plot visualizing this data is shown in Figure 
8.7. The feature, square feet is on the x axis and 
the label, the price, is on the y axis. The price is 
what the model needs to learn to predict.
The linear regression equation for this would be 
(Equation 8.3)
Price = w0 + w1 x Square Feet
Figure 8.5 Lines with diﬀ  erent orientations for diﬀ  erent w0,w1 values (31.89, 0.58) and (221.65, -0.79)
Figure 8.6 Example dataset with one feature Square Feet 
and Label Price

209 Linear Regression Linear RegressionFigure 8.5 Lines with diﬀ  erent orientations for diﬀ  erent w0,w1 values (31.89, 0.58) and (221.65, -0.79)If something else was being predicted, then price would be replaced by whatever needed to be 
predicted and square feet would be replaced by the feature. Note that this equation remains the same. 
The way linear regression tries to predict is by ﬁ  tting a line to your data, and the equation of the line 
remains the same. The features, label and the model parameters w0 and w1 will have diﬀ  erent values 
depending on the problem, but the structure of the equation does not change. This is both the strength 
and weakness of linear regression. If the line ﬁ  ts, linear regression works great. If the line is not a good 
ﬁ  t, linear regression will not work well.
Mathematically, there are several ways to ﬁ  nd values of w0 and w1 that satisfy the above conditions. 
However, in the real world, it is possible that no values of w0 and w1 can satisfy all the samples in the 
training dataset. In such a case, the algorithm ﬁ  gures out the values of (w0,w1) that best approximate 
the above equations for all the training examples on an average. The process of ﬁ  guring out the best 
values of (w0,w1) based on the training data is called training in linear regression.What Happens During Training
During training, a dataset such as the one shown in Figure 8.6 is provided to the algorithm. The linear 
regression model is represented by (w0,w1). These values are unknown and during the training phase, 
the algorithm ﬁ  gures out the best values for w0 and w1. The equation of the linear regression model is 
given by Equation 8.3. For example 8.6, perfect values of w0 and w1 would satisfy the following for the 
training dataset:
500 = w0 + w1 x 1250
2200 = w0 = w1 x 3200
350 = w0 + w1 x 950
950 = w0 + w1 x 2100
It is easy to visualize the line in two dimensions. In 
three dimensions, this becomes a plane, shown in 
Figure 8.8.
In higher dimensions, the equation remains the 
same, but it is hard to visualize it. In higher 
dimensions, it is called a hyper-plane.

equation when there are two featuresModel parameters are the values in the model that aﬀ  ect how it converts 
input data into a prediction. All algorithms generate models and all 
models have model parameters, but the type of parameters depends on 
the algorithm. In linear regression, the coeﬃ   cients of the equation are the 
model parameters. Concept

Figure 8.9 shows a dataset with four features. In 
this case the equation of the linear regression model 
would have more parameters. Equation 8.5 shows the 
equation linear regression will build:
Average = w0 + w1 x A + w2 x B + w3 x C + w4 x D
Note that in this dataset, the label is the average of the 
four features. So the relationship is still linear.
Exercise: Guess the model parametersExercise: Guess the model parameters
A linear regression model is training on the data provided in Figure 8.9. The Equation of the 
linear regression model is given by Equation 8.5.
What would be the perfect values for w0, w1, w2, w3 and w4 that would capture the relationship 
between the features and the label perfectly ?
Hint: The true relationship between the features and the label is given by Average = (A + B + C 
+ D)/4. The label in this dataset happens to be the average of the four features.

Evaluate a Linear Regression Model
Linear Regression algorithm predicts a numerical value and hence is only used to solve regression 
problems. The metrics for evaluating a linear regression model are the same as the metrics used for 
any regression type of algorithm. Both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error 
(RMSE) are used to indicate the performance of the algorithm.
Given a RMSE value, would it be possible to decide if the AI is good enough? This depends on 
what is being predicted and how much error is considered acceptable for an application.
If you are predicting the price of a house and are oﬀ   by $10, that is an acceptable value.
However, if the AI is predicting the temperature and is oﬀ   by 10 degrees centigrade, it’s not an 
acceptable error. The scale of the label being predicted by the AI determines whether a given 
RMSE or MAE value is acceptable or not. For example, the scale of the variable being predicted in 
Figure 8.9 is (419.5, 744). This is essentially the minimum and the maximum value that we expect 
from the model. Errors should be evaluated relative to the values of the labels.
ContextEquation 8.5


211 Linear Regression Linear Regression
A linear regression algorithm can only predict 
data which follows a linear relationship like the 
one shown in Figure 8.9. If the data has a non-
linear relationship like the one in Equation 8.6, 
linear regression cannot model it and hence will 
make bad predictions.
                  label = feature x featurePi�  alls in Linear Regression
This implies that linear regression is a good choice if the data inherently has a certain kind of 
relationship. In the real world, there are 100s or 1000s of features with millions of samples. It 
is hard to visualize or understand whether linear regression would be a good model for it or not. 
Therefore, data scientists often need to simply try it out and evaluate the results to ﬁ  nd out if it’s a 
good algorithm for the dataset or not.Visually, for a single feature, examples of linear and non-linear relationships are 
shown in Figure 8.11.Figure 8.10 Example of a dataset with a single 
feature and a non-linear relationship

Core Concepts
Linear Regression is the most popular type of regression algorithm in use today. While it 
is not suitable for every application, its simplicity and overall robustness makes it the ﬁ  rst 
algorithm that is usually tried for regression problems. After studying this chapter, students 
should be able to:
• Understand what Linear Regression does
• Identify possible uses of Linear Regression
• Understand the limitations of Linear Regression and be able to identify cases where it is 
unlikely to work well
• Be able to measure the eﬀ  ectiveness of Linear Regression for a problem.
Grade Level Alignment
The concepts in this chapter are accessible to students in any Middle School or High School 
grade, with two exceptions. 
• RMSE is challenging for 6th and 7th grade students and is recommended for students in 
8th grade and above.
• Students who have studied basic algebra (in particular those who have learned equations 
such as y=mx+b) will have a greater appreciation for how Linear Regression can 
construct an equation to ﬁ  t data.
The plugged exercises at the end of the chapter can also be used by students in any middle 
school or high school grade. The python coding exercises however, are more suitable for 
students in grades 8 and above, or any student that has familiarity with the following python 
elements
• Input/Output
• Loops and Conditionals
• Lists
• Modules
• Pandas and Dataframes
• SciKit Learn Module
The Curriculum section below contains introductions to all of these Python elements.  


Linear Regression 220Teachers Corner
Tips
Encourage students to explore additional uses of Linear Regression with datasets that they 
gather themselves. What can they predict in their lives with Linear Regression? For example:
• Are their test scores proportional to the number of hours they study?
• Can they predict the prices of houses in their neighborhood??
Help students understand that for Linear Regression to work, the relationship between what is 
being predicted and the input needs to be linear. It does not require that when the input goes 
up, the predicted value should also go up. It is okay if the input goes up and the prediction 
goes down, as long as it does down linearly.
Explore cases where Linear Regression will not work. For example
• Can Linear Regression predict the multiple of two numbers. If there is one number A 
and a second number B, can Linear Regression predict AxB? It cannot. Why is that? It is 
because multiplication is not linear.

K Mean Clustering222


223 K Mean Clustering K Mean ClusteringCHAPTER 
9K-Means Clustering
In this chapter, a popular unsupervised learning algorithm called K means clustering 
is introduced. This algorithm is quite popular and very easy to understand. Unlike 
other algorithms covered in this book. K-Means clustering is an example of 
unsupervised learning, and can thus be used with data that does not have labels.


K Mean Clustering 224
 K Mean Clustering
 224
Figure 9.1 Example of dataset with two 
features clustered into 3 groups Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that is used for dividing data into groups. 
Typically, these groups have something in common within themselves and some diﬀ  erences with 
data in other groups. For example, college students at a university can be clustered into diﬀ  erent 
disciplines like computer science, economics, music etc. Here, the common aspect within each 
group is that they are pursuing the same discipline of study. The primary feature based on which 
this clustering has happened is the discipline . This is of course an oversimpliﬁ  ed example. 
Real data will have more than one feature 
in it and grouping/clustering needs to be 
done by taking into account all the features 
in the data. Note that data does not have 
any labels in this case. Since the data 
does not need any labels and the goal is to 
simply group the data based on the features 
alone, its an unsupervised method.
Clustering into diﬀ  erent groups can be done in several diﬀ  erent ways. For example, a data point 
may belong to more than one cluster. A college student may have a major and a minor in diﬀ  erent 
disciplines. In this case, they can be assigned a probability to be in each of the clusters/disciplines 
rather than a single cluster/discipline. This type of clustering is called soft clustering. The other 
type, where the data point belongs only to a single cluster is called hard clustering.
Figure 9.2 Hard and soft clustering examples, where the number of clusters is 2 Introduction to Clustering 
224
Hard Clustering So�   Clustering


225 K Mean Clustering K Mean Clustering
Clustering data into diﬀ  erent groups depends on the metric of similarity or closeness between 
diﬀ  erent points. This leads to a rich array of techniques and algorithms that can be used for clustering 
data. In this module, a high level explanation of some of the popular clustering types is provided.
Hierarchical clustering assumes that data points 
in close proximity should belong to the same 
group. How one can measure close proximity 
depends on the metric chosen for similarity. 
Euclidean distance between points is a popular 
metric for measuring distance. One of the 
disadvantages of this method is that it cannot 
handle big datasets. 
Centroid based clustering groups data based on 
its closeness to centroid. K-Means clustering 
algorithm is a popular example in this category 
and we will explore it in detail in this chapter. The 
process of grouping data is done over iterations 
where the clusters get reﬁ  ned with each iteration 
till all data is stable and does not change its 
membership to groups.Figure 9.3 Clustering achieved by a hierarchical methodology
Figure 9.4 Clustering achieved by k-means clustering. Types of Clustering Algorithms
Distribution based clustering group data based on 
the distribution statistics of the data. A popular 
example is the Expectation Maximization model. 
Data points that are more likely to belong to the 
same distribution where the distribution is of type 
Gaussian are grouped together. 
Figure 9.6 Clustering based on density. Figure 9.5 Clustering based on Gaussian distribution. 
Density based clustering has a concept of noise or 
outliers in data. It groups data based on how dense the 
data is, where dense implies how close/similar it is. 
If there are data points that are relatively far from all 
other data points, they are not assigned a group and 
assumed to be noise. 


K Mean Clustering 226Figure 9.7 shows a plot of data, where there are only two 
features are weight and length. A K-means algorithm 
starts by picking K centroids at random locations. The 
value of K should be provided to K-means algorithm 
before it can begin. Depending on which random 
location the centroids initialize with, the ﬁ  nal clusters 
can be diﬀ  erent. This means that K-means algorithm can 
provide diﬀ  erent clusters of the data points when run 
multiple times. Even when two diﬀ  erent runs of K-means 
algorithm result in the same grouping, the name/number

Customer/market segmentation is an important 
application where businesses divide their customers 
into diﬀ  erent groups before advertising or 
recommending products to them. In the telecom 
industry for example, there are a large number of 
customers with information about their usage patterns 
such as how they recharge, make calls, send SMS 
etc. The analysis using k-means revealed 7 customer 
segments/clusters which lead to understanding the 
needs of each segment more eﬀ  ectively. This in turn 
helps the companies to cater to needs of diﬀ  erent 
segments more eﬀ  ectively and retain their business 
with them.The goal of a K-means clustering algorithm is to ﬁ  nd groups in data, where the number of groups is 
represented by the variable K. The algorithm follows an iterative process to group data and we will go 
over it in this section.

Figure 9.9 (a) shows random initialization of two centroids. After this, data points are assigned to the 
closest centroid. Figure 9.9 (b) shows the two clusters in yellow and green color. This is iteration 1 of 
the k-means algorithm. Based on the grouping of the points into two clusters, new centroid values are 
calculated. This new centroid location can be calculated as the average of the two features `weight` 
and `length` belonging to the respective centroids.

K Mean Clustering 228Clustering is performed in an unsupervised setting where there are no labels. When a clustering 
algorithm like K-means comes up with a grouping of data, how does one measure its quality? Metrics 
for measuring the quality of grouping are explored in this section.
Metrics for Clustering Quality
Silhoue�  e Score
Silhouette Score is a very popular metric to measure clustering quality. The score ranges from -1 to 
+1. A silhouette score of -1 is the worst possible value and +1 is the highest possible score indicating 
good clustering.
This score is calculated using two variables a and b. a is the mean distance between a sample and all 
other points in the same cluster and b is the mean distance between a sample and all other points in the 
next nearest cluster. For a single sample, the silhouette score is given by Equation 9.1.
Mean value of the silhouette score for all samples is the aggregate score for an entire dataset.
Davies-Bouldin Index
Davies-Bouldin index is also a very popular metric to measure clustering quality. The score ranges 
from 0 to 1. A Davies-Bouldin index of value 1 is the worst possible value and 0 is the lowest possible 
value indicating good clustering.
This score is calculated using two variables n and σ. n is the number of clusters. σi is the mean 
distance of all data points belonging to cluster i from the centroid of the cluster denoted by ci d(ci,cj).
The Davies-Bouldin score is given by Equation 9.2.
Equation 9.1

How to Determine a Good K Value
The K-means algorithm relies on the fact that K is provided to the algorithm. However, in many 
practical scenarios, this value is not known prior to grouping of data. Two methods to ﬁ  gure out a 
good value of K are described in this section.
The Elbow Method
Silhoue�  e AnalysisTo determine a good value of K, one has to ﬁ  rst run 
the k-means algorithm for several diﬀ  erent values 
of K. Example in Figure 9.12 shows an experiment 
where the K value is varied between 1 and 9. The 
average distance of a data point from its cluster 
centroid is the y-axis. Note that this value is bound 
to keep going down as the number of clusters 
increases.
Note that the curve in Figure 9.12 looks like an 
elbow. As the number of clusters keep increasing, 
the gain one gets in terms of lower average distance 
from centroid keeps diminishing. Visually, one can 
inspect this plot and say that K=3 is the optimal 
value for this dataset. Figure 9.12: Illustration of the elbow method. The red circle 
indicates the optimal value of K..
Figure 9.13: Plot indicating Silhouette score for
diﬀ  erent values of K.The Silhouette score is a good measure of 
clustering quality. This score can be calculated 
for several diﬀ  erent values of K and plotted with 
the value of K on x-axis and the score itself on 
y-axis as shown in Figure 9.13.
Since a high value of silhouette score indicates a 
good clustering quality, one can then choose the 
value of K that has the highest value. 
Note that both methods to determine a good K value need the K-means algorithm to be run several times 
with diﬀ  erent values of K. This can be computationally expensive and is one of the disadvantages of the 
approach.

Core Concepts
Clustering is the most popular use of unsupervised learning and K-Means is a powerful and 
commonly used approach to clustering. After studying this chapter, students should be able 
to:
• Understand why clustering is a type of unsupervised learning
• Appreciate how clustering can be used in real-life situations
• Understand what K-Means does and how it works
• Understand that clustering (and other unsupervised learning algorithms) cannot be 
measured in the same way that supervised learning algorithms are measured
• Be able to identify the common metrics for measuring clustering eﬀ  ectiveness and how 
they are used.
Grade Level Alignment
The overall concepts in this chapter are accessible to any grade level in middle school and 
high school. The silhouette score metric is accessible to any grade level, but may require 
additional eﬀ  ort to understand in grades 6 and 7. The other metrics (such as the Davies-
Bouldin index) are better taught to students at 8th grade and above.
The plugged exercises at the end of the chapter can also be used by students in any middle 
school or high school grade. The python coding exercises however, are more suitable for 
students in grades 8 and above, or any student that has familiarity with the following python 
elements
• Input/Output
• Loops and Conditionals
• Lists
• Modules
• SciKit Learn Module
The Curriculum section below contains introductions to all of these Python elements.  
Tips
Encourage students to ﬁ  nd uses for clustering in their daily lives. For example
• If a child did not know the names Cat and Dog, would they still be able to group cats as 
one kind of animal (for example because they meow) and dogs as another kind of animal 
(because they bark)?

CHAPTER 
10Deep Learning 
Deep Learning is a large and important field of AI that uses a technology called 
Neural Networks. While neural networks have been around for many decades, 
they have recently come into prominence because they have been shown to 
be adept at creating AIs that can use rich data such as images, video, sound, 
text and so on. This chapter covers several types of neural networks that solve 
classification problems for images, and provides an overview of the field of 
Deep Learning, its applications, and trends.

240 Before we can understand 
what a Neural Network is, 
let’s explore a single Neuron.  
Figure 10.1 shows an example 
of a basic neuron, called a 
Perceptron. It takes in several 
values, applies some kind 
of mathematical function 
to them, and generates an 
output. Each input has a 
weight applied to it. 
The process of training a neural network involves changing these weights and fi  nding the best value 
for the weights. While this may seem simple for a single neuron, real world neural networks have 
millions of neurons and many millions or even billions of weights, making training challenging.Neuron
What is Neural Network?
Figure 10.2 Example weights and function for a neuronFigure 10.1 An example of a single neuron
By changing the weights, the neuron can decide to prioritize (or take more notice of) some inputs 
over others. It can even ignore some inputs entirely by setting their weights to zero. Figure 10.2 
shows an example of what weights and a function can look like.


241 Deep Learning Deep Learning 
A neural network is, as expected, a network of neurons. Figure 10.3 shows a simple example of a neural 
network, called a Multi-Layer Perception  (MLP). An MLP is also called a fully connected network. 
The network has an Input Layer, an Output Layer, and some number of Hidden Layers (in our example 
there is one hidden layer). 
Each layer can have many neurons. In the example, the input layer has 3 neurons, the hidden layer has 4 
neurons, and the output layer has 2 neurons. Each neuron takes inputs from the layer before it and sends 
its output to the next layer. In an MLP, each neuron is connected to every neuron in its neighboring 
layers. A Neural Network
Size of Real World Neural NetworksSize of Real World Neural Networks
The number of neurons in a neural network depends on its architecture. The number of hidden 
layers, the types of layers, the number of neurons in each layer etc all defi  ne a neural network’s 
architecture and determine its size. In the real world, neural networks are used in varied applications 
such as image classifi  cation, language translation, question and answering, and more. A typical 
image classifi  cation neural network in the real world has 5,000 to 60,000 neurons. The architecture 
of neural networks diff  ers between diff  erent applications, and each one is quite sophisticated in 
itself. The complexity of training a neural network is measured by the number of parameters rather 
than the number of neurons. The number of parameters is the number of weights in the network. 
Real world neural networks can have millions or even billions of weights and can take hours to days 
(or sometimes even weeks) to train.

What is Deep Learning?
There are many types of neural networks, and they diff  er in various ways. Some ways that neural 
networks diff  er include the structure of the neurons themselves, the way neurons are connected, and 
of course the number of layers. This is where deep learning comes in. Neural networks with a very 
large number of layers are called Deep Neural Networks, and the technology to train and manage 
deep neural networks is called Deep Learning.
Figure 10.4 shows the history of neural networks over the past few years. You can see that the 
depth of these networks has increased substantially as researchers have discovered new ways to 
construct networks that can train in a stable and reliable way while having lots of layers. The larger 
the network, the more likely that it can tackle a tough problem with rich data like images and video.
Other factors have also helped researchers build deeper neural networks. Datasets are getting bigger. 
As seen in previous chapters, data can now be gathered from everything from sensors to cameras. 
Computers have also gotten more powerful. All of these factors have made it possible to create 
deeper and more eff  ective neural networks.There is a popular AI Challenge in the images domain called ImageNet. Researchers all over the 
world compete and submit their models to it every year. The dataset consists of more than 14 million 
images. Deep neural networks have been winning this competition since 2010. Every year, the depth 
of the network that wins the challenge keeps increasing.
Figure 10.4 The depth of neural networks winning the ImageNet challenge, year by year.

Types of Deep Learning
As mentioned before, there are many types of neural networks. Similarly, there are many types of deep 
learning that are used to train diff  erent types of neural networks. Some common types of deep learning 
are:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks  (CNNs): These are popular for processing and classifying images.
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): These neural networks are good for data that has some type 
of sequence. An example is a sentence where the order of the words is important to the meaning. A 
particular type of RNN is a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM).
Researchers are always experimenting with new neural network architectures and fi  nding the best ones 
that work. For example, a very recent type of neural network, called a Transformer, has been shown 
to be really good at language problems (like question and answer or summarizing text). This type of 
neural network can also make some really cool chatbots.
Deep Learning in Self Driving CarsDeep Learning in Self Driving Cars
Self-driving cars use a lot of deep learning technology. A self driving car has many cameras within 
it that are used to take pictures of the surrounding environment. Using the AIs, the car needs to 
determine what types of objects are around it and how fast and in what direction the objects are 
moving. It needs to be able to identify other cars, pedestrians, bicyclists, traﬃ   c signs, puddles on 
the road, fi  res, and anything else it should expect on the road.
The technology used to do this is called object detection and object recognition. The fi  rst step is to 
identify the many objects in the single image. The second step is to identify what each object is.  
This also needs to be done in real time and very fast. There is no benefi  t in identifying a pedestrian 
after the car has run into them! 
To accomplish this feat, self-driving cars use deep learning AIs that have been trained on massive 
numbers of images, trying to capture everything that the car may encounter on the road. When the 
car is driving, it uses these models to determine the objects around it.

Deep Learning 244
Supervised or Unsupervised?
Deep learning gets its name because it is based on deep neural networks. Many of the deep learning 
techniques and uses are supervised learning. In the rest of this chapter, we will focus heavily on image 
classifi  cation with deep learning, which is a supervised learning problem.
However, deep learning is not limited to supervised learning. It can also be used for unsupervised 
learning problems.
Image Classifi  cation
A very common use of deep learning is for image classifi  cation. Figure 10.6 shows how this works. 
The concepts are identical to what was covered in Chapter 5 about classifi  cation. The only diff  erence 
is that, instead of feeding the AI a table of data to learn from, we feed it a set of images. Since this is 
a supervised learning AI, there are still labels. Each image is now associated with its label (the right 
answer). 
Since image classifi  cation, even though it uses deep learning, is still classifi  cation, everything covered 
so far about classifi  cation still applies. Accuracy  and Confusion Matrix can still be used to measure 
a deep learning image classifi  cation AI. Training and prediction mean exactly what they did before. 
The model in this case is the trained neural network with the values of all of its weights. The feature 
in this case is the image or a subset of it, depending on what type of deep learning is used. The dataset 
is the set of images, and the accuracy is still computed as before, using a random subset of the images 
as a test dataset.Figure 10.6 Image Classifi  cation


245 Deep Learning Deep Learning Figure 10.6 Image Classifi  cationBefore we can learn how neural networks process images, we will need to learn how computers in 
general process images. Images are stored in computers as a set of pixels, where each pixel value 
refl  ects the intensity of color in a small part of the image. Figure 10.7 shows a pixelated image - an 
image with so few pixels that the human eye can see each pixel. While images like this can be found, 
for example, in very old video games, most images today contain millions of pixels and the human 
eye cannot see the pixels (this is also why the images are such high quality). 
How does a Neural Network Process 
Images?
Figure 10.7 A pixelated imageWhat is a pixel?
In a black and white image - a pixel 
is a number that shows the grayness 
of that part of the image. In Figure 
10.8, you can see that the white 
pixels are 0, the black ones are 1 and 
the grey ones are 0.5. Sometimes 
pixel values can also range from 0 
to 255. 
A color image has more information. 
Each pixel is actually three values, 
the Redness, Greenness and 
Blueness (RGB) of the pixel. These 
can again range from 0 to a max 
value like 255. 
When a computer processes 
images, it sees the image as a grid 
of numbers if the image is black and 
white, and as three grids of numbers 
if the image is color.

Pixel counts in digital cameras over timePixel counts in digital cameras over time
The metric most often used by camera manufacturers and marketers to tout their products 
has been pixel count. In the beginning, the 1990s—there was a great need for more pixels. 
But by 2000, pixel counts plateaued at 3.3 megapixels. At that number, the sensor was 
relatively cheap to produce, and the resulting images had just enough resolution to print 
images.
Nowadays, 12-, 14-, and 16-megapixel point-and-shoot digitals are the rule rather than the 
exception, and cellphones routinely off  er 5-, 8-, and even 12-megapixel resolution.
What is a pixel and why should we care about how many we have in a camera?  Essentially , 
at the heart of every digital camera is an image sensor. The lens focuses photons refl  ected by 
the scene being photographed onto that image sensor. Etched into the image sensor’s silicon 
are pixels (short for picture elements )—technically, photo receptor or photo diode sites. Each 
pixel is a single point that collects the electrons, which are then interpreted into information 
about color and light. The signals from pixels are processed into a recognizable image. The 
more pixels, the more information collected and the larger the photo.

Flatt  ening Images
Now that we know how computers see images, how do AIs, and neural networks in particular, take 
input images? For simple neural networks, like the MLP described earlier, this is done by a process 
called fl  attening. The grid of pixels is transformed into a column of pixels, and the fi  rst layer of 
the neural network will contain as many neurons as there are pixels. Figure 10.10 shows how this 
works. There is a 5x5 grid of pixels that has become a 25 high column of pixels. The input layer of 
the MLP has 25 neurons, each of which will read one of the pixels.

Figure 10.10 Flattening an image
Figure 10.11 shows what the image looks like after fl  attening. What this table shows is an example 
image with 25 pixels. You can see that it is a table, much like other datasets that we have seen before. 
This table can now be used by any AI algorithm to try to learn the patterns. Each image is a sample. 
Each pixel is a feature. The column name represents the row and column number.
1_11_21_31_41_52_12_22_32_42_53_13_23_33_43_54_14_24_34_44_55_15_25_35_45_5Label

Figure 10.11 Flattening an image converts every pixel into a feature. Now the data is a table, but 
with a very large number of features!!
Figure 10.12  is another example of an image, with a resolution of 28x28 pixels. This is also a gray 
scale image. From the brightly colored pixels, it can be seen that the image is a handwritten 5. This 
image will translate into a dataset with 784 pixels. It is clear how the number of features can explode 
to be a large number when the number of pixels in an image is high. With images captured in today’s 
cameras and phones, this is bound to be millions of pixels.
Flattening is the process of converting every image to 
a row in a table, where each column is a pixel. FlatteningConcept


Deep Learning 248
Figure 10.12 How a single black and white image of a handwritten number 5 converts into 784 
features, one for every pixel value.
An MLP that can use such an image could look like Figure 10.13. It contains an input layer with 784 
neurons, two hidden layers with 16 nodes and an output layer with 10 nodes, one node for each number/
category being predicted.
This is a very simple neural network by deep learning standards, but it is quite eff  ective at detecting 
black and white handwritten digits. The sample images in these fi  gures are taken from a famous dataset 
of black and white handwritten digits, called MNIST. MLP classifi  ers like the one shown in Figure 10.13 
can generate accuracies of 90% or above for detecting handwritten digits.
The MNIST dataset is a world famous simple dataset for neural networks. It consists of 
handwritten digits 0-9 in white on a black background. Datasets like this are great for 
getting started with deep learning.

Figure 10.13 How an image as shown in Figure 10.10 can be fl  attened and input into an MLP, 
with 784 neurons in the input layer and each neuron taking one of the pixels.
Why not use Machine Learning on the 
Flattened Data?
Now that the data has been fl  attened and the collection of images are now a table, why do we need to 
use deep learning? Why wouldn’t any other classifi  cation algorithm (like KNN) work? 
In general, it is possible to feed the fl  attened image dataset into any machine learning algorithm. 
However, since fl  attening creates a very large number of features, the deep neural networks are often 
better at processing the fl  attened images. For a purely black and white dataset of 784 pixels per image, 
a KNN, as an example, may generate an adequate result. However, as the image size grows, deep 
neural networks outperform classic machine learning algorithms. 


Deep Learning 250Inputs without Flattening
While simple neural networks, like MLP, take flattened images, their approach of creating one feature 
per pixel makes them impractical for modern color images which can have millions of pixels and 
three values per pixel (for RGB color). Fortunately, there are more powerful neural networks, like 
Convolutional Neural Networks, that can read images directly. They do this by a process called 
convolution, where they pass grids of the image through a filter (a simple analogy is a magnifying 
glass) and feed the pixels to the next layer. Figure 10.14 shows how a single convolution operation 
between an image and a convolution filter works. However, the output is shown for a single convolution. 
Convolution of the filter with the entire image is shown in figure 10.15. The complete convolution 
results in an output image of size 3x3 with a total of 9 individual convolution operations.
A convolution layer typically contains many such convolution filters. Each filter can be of a different 
size. The above filter was 3x3. However, there can be filters that are 7x7, 5x5 etc as well. Each 
convolution filter can be thought of as a special type of neuron.
Training a Convolutional Neural Network
When training a CNN, the images are fed directly into the first layer of the neural network (without 
flattening). The filters include weights that are set as part of the training process. As the training process 
occurs, the network “learns” how to tune its filters. In other words, the network decides for itself which 
aspects of the image will be the focus of each layer and each filter .

Challenges in Deep Learning
Deep learning has achieved tremendous success over the last decade in many fi  elds where rich data 
(images, voice, text, video, etc.) is used. Examples include self-driving cars, healthcare, agriculture, 
etc. However, the technology is not without its challenges. In chapter 4, some of the ethical challenges 
of AI included bias and environmental impact. These areas are more diﬃ   cult in deep learning than 
in classical machine learning.
1. Deep learning algorithms, due to their complexity, are not yet explainable. This means that it is 
diﬃ   cult for humans to determine how a deep learning AI made its decisions. If a deep learning AI is 
biased, or has learned bias, it is diﬃ   cult to determine that the bias has been learned. Researchers are 
focusing on ways to understand how deep learning models work and new tools for explaining model 
predictions are being developed.
2. Deep learning models are some of the largest in the world. As an example, the simple linear 
regression models covered in Chapter 8 contained 10s of values in the model (the equation 
coeﬃ   cients). The simplest deep learning models we covered in this chapter contain thousands of 
values in the model (the weights). This complexity is why deep learning can solve problems that 
conventional machine learning cannot. However, the size of the models makes the AIs expensive 
and resource hungry. 
Can I assemble my own neural network? Or 
use an existing one?
It is certainly possible to assemble a unique neural network (and many researchers do this on a 
regular basis). However, for more common use, computer scientists tend to rely on neural network 
architectures already used by others. Why is this?
1. The neural network architecture is already proven for the task (for images, for example, the 
popular neural network architectures became so by doing well on the ImageNet challenge)
2. There are already software programs for them and it is easy to pick them up and train on your 
own data.
3. Training a neural network takes a lot of resources. Using an architecture that is already proven 
to work saves time.
At the time of this book’s writing, popular CNNs that are often reused are the Residual Neural 
Network (ResNet), which comes in various fl  avors (ResNet101, ResNet152, etc.). Other popular 
patterns include MobileNetV2, Inception V3 etc.


253 Deep Learning Deep Learning 
Trends in Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a rapidly evolving fi  eld, with many new inventions coming out every day. A few 
trends in deep learning include:
1. More and more data. Deep neural networks benefi  t from having a lot of data. Researchers are 
looking for ways to train with less data, but in general having more data helps.
2. Custom hardware. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are now used regularly for deep learning. 
However, new custom hardware is being built for deep learning because the AIs are so expensive and 
resource intensive to build. Google has built their own custom hardware (called the TPU - Tensor 
Processing Unit), and other companies are working on hardware architectures as well.
3. New algorithms and new networks. Every year new neural architectures are developed. Some 
attempt to solve harder problems or get better results on existing problems. Others attempt to solve 
existing problems nearly as well but with fewer resources.
